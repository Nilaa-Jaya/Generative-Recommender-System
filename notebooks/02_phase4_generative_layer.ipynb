who is about to leave for his native land before he goes many people have just one question to ask him in a very few words he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a non ##den ##omi ##national way the only exceptions come in the references to rebirth the essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that god does and wants us to let me give you an example when someone trans ##gre ##sse ##s either mans laws or gods laws we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment this is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again surely our reaction should still focus like a mothers on the fundamental human ##ness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing loving and helpful part of our community another way to think about the lessons of the prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance if we interfere with nature nature over ##rea ##cts in some new way that counters our interference this happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes algae blooms expand exponential ##ly to eat the phosphate these lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction a good parallel can be found in the study of the brain our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain this part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in fight or flight reactions that can save our lives in the near ##ter ##m in the civilized world we often have these reactions just to stress gi ##bra ##n is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near and long ##ter ##m best interests as individuals and as a community many eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind and that sense of object ##ivity is captured nicely here i have a feeling much like when med ##itating while i read the prophet because of its calming influence on my over ##rea ##ctive senses i also think of this perspective like being on the moon and observing the circumstances on earth through a telescope with such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego to permit good thinking but none of these perspectives are directly suggested or all ##uded to the moral lessons are simply there with the brief ##est possible examples to make them clear as such they are masterpiece ##s of good thinking moral ethics and fine communication the answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them i suggest you select another member of your family or a group of people from your house of worship the lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day certainly it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection whenever you feel overwhelmed turn to the page in the prophet that addresses your issue like taking a warm bath you will be soothe ##d by the love for humanity in the answers gi ##bra ##n provides before you speak ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want an old time favorite this book arrived almost immediately great service its a gift for a granddaughter that i hope she will love as much as i do i really liked this edition as a gift iv ##e had a copy of this book in my collection for over thirty six years and felt it would be a great gift for newly wed ##s compared it to works like tara ##nt ##ula by bob dylan purchased this time as a gift it was received with praise per its current cover i can never quite make up my mind on this book i read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it re ##rea ##ding it i feel vague inspiring feeling and the other a kind of vague rep ##ulsion i see many many readers are inspired by the work i myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of whitman and za ##rath ##ust ##ra but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter i believe the most famous section of the work of twenty six poetic essays is the one on love here is some of this love gives na ##ught but itself and takes na ##ught but from itself love possesses not nor would it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love when you love you should not say god is in my heart but rather i am in the heart of god and think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course love has no other desire but to fu ##lf ##il itself but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night to know the pain of too much tenderness to be wounded by your own understanding of love and to bleed willingly and joy ##fully to wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving to rest at the noon hour and med ##itate loves ecstasy to return home at event ##ide with gratitude and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips i am reminded when i read this of bell ##ows description of the healer in seize the day dr te ##m ##kin on the one hand he says and thinks that it is ph ##ony and on the other he hears certain things and says true true i must admit my reaction remains mixed i do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value but i do not feel it is without value either i enjoy reading a chapter each evening the prophet is al ##mus ##ta ##fa called the chosen and the beloved who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of or ##pha ##lese and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth just as the ship appears all the men and women of the community including the elders of the city and the priests and priestess ##es come to say farewell they ask him to stay but he refuses then the local see ##ress named al ##mit ##ra addresses him as prophet of god and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage after this others ask him to speak of various subjects some loft ##y such as children giving and joy and

between poetry and prose the prophet is said to be an early example of inspirational fiction consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic english prose the book became especially

a spiritual masterpiece so when i found it in my fathers library after his death i decided to keep it and read it my reaction is u ##gh as far as i am concerned it is mostly pan ##the ##istic nonsense someone might say its all greek to me but since i took two years of greek in college if it were all greek i might be able to make some sense of it ill just say its all go ##bble ##ty ##go ##ok to me the chicago post said that the prophet brings to ones ears the majestic rhythm of ec ##cles ##ias ##tes ec ##cles ##ias ##tes i can understand the prophet i do not this doesn ##t mean that there ##s nothing good in it the ravi ##ng ##s of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth even a broken clock is right twice a day however there is nothing of value that might be gained from the prophet which can ##t be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the bible besides ten of the twelve full ##page drawings by the author are rather im ##mo ##des ##t and consist solely of nude figures of course this is not surprising when you read what the prophet says about clothes your clothes conceal much of your beauty yet they hide not the un ##beau ##ti ##ful and though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your rai ##ment oh by the way even as simply poetry it just doesn ##t do anything for me it is not a book that i would recommend to anyone under any circumstances i am alive like you and i am standing beside you close your eyes and look around you will see me in front of you gi ##bra ##ns words on his ep ##ita ##ph the prophet captures the teachings of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n in a comforting story that su ##cci ##nc ##tly touches on everyday topics like love giving joy sorrow freedom pain teaching friendship and beauty within each tiny chapter profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n magical ##ly explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience the more joy you can contain talking becomes thoughts that can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart so they live in your lips as al ##mus ##ta ##fa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea when his ship arrives he is suddenly filled with regret yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home long were the days of pain i have spent within its walls and long were the nights of alone ##ness and who can depart from his pain and his alone ##ness without regret the priests and priestess ##es ask him to remain in very poetic ways let not the waves of the sea separate us now and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory al ##mus ##ta ##fa only cries and doesn ##t seem to speak until a woman named al ##mit ##ra appears she is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fond ##ness for her we are not given any insight into their relationship but his respect for her is un ##quest ##ioned she understands he must leave but asks him to give the city his wisdom she promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations while viewing pictures of bs ##har ##ri in northern lebanon the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns mind he lived in a lush region where cas ##ca ##ding falls rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing we can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager a boston ##ian poet josephine peabody caught gi ##bra ##ns attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as her young prophet she also wrote poems about gi ##bra ##ns life and how she imagined his life in bs ##har ##ri his life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways he names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from lebanon to new york the story has an una ##ss ##uming plot but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender i was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mist ##s of bs ##har ##ri the prophet is not just a book to read it is a spiritual journey to experience it may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book i could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n the rebecca review echoing the reviews of others it is obvious that gi ##bra ##n both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages from buddha to coe ##hl ##o and countless others in between there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that once lifted opens the mind heart and soul to universal wisdom it is not hard to understand why gi ##bra ##n was as popular in his day and in the s as he was covering the landscape from religion to love gi ##bra ##n bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey the metaphor ##s are numerous and the scale

speak about different subjects of life such as on beauty on good and evil on marriage on joy and sorrow on friendship and many more i have to say that if i had come across this book much earlier in my life i know i would not have understood or appreciated the beauty of it i mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago and she had never read it i told her what a treasure it was and after finally reading it she loved it too there is so much wisdom here to learn from this is an incredible book the prophet is an elegant and beautifully crafted piece of art that el ##o ##quent ##ly states universal truths concerning all per ##tine ##nt aspects of our ##li ##ve these include love death justice art etc its divine poet ##r that could have only been inspired by the creator of this magnificent world highly recommended happy happy happy i recently re ##rea ##d this after many years and found the words to res ##onate with wisdom and spiritual centered ##ness the book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faith ##s and traditions each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart there is nothing in the prophet that would contra ##dict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the worlds major religions it somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature no issues good this book is poetic myth a work of beauty whose every word drip ##s a truth and a thought of knowledge reading it is like swimming in reality but a reality i have not known till now ka ##hli ##l ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n knew something we did not he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity though this is merely the preaching of a prophet gi ##bra ##n is able to turn it into story and i feel from the gut for all the characters the prophet is un ##sur ##pass ##ed in form in content best when speaking of beauty in ways i had never known and weak ##est when speaking of prayer certainly gi ##bra ##n relies on the story of jesus and throughout there are all ##usions to his words and actions but this is a new prophet who speaks the words of old though it be in new wines ##kin i usually don ##t like getting books that i did not ask for when someone buys a book for me there is a certain obligation to actually read it but doing so takes away time from the books i really want to read there are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an una ##ske ##df ##or book feels like someone actually stealing from me stealing valuable reading time in the case of the prophet however i did not res ##ent the choice of my benefactor even though i had not asked for it first of all it was a very quick read consisting of twenty ##nine poetic speeches by the fictional prophet he delivers them as his last word on various topics since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life family food work emotions economics social problems art morality spirituality death etc on most of these issues the prophet takes what might be called an eastern stance he stresses the importance of letting go rather than taking charge whether its in relationship to your children conflict situations or the end of your life i did not find it necessary however to fully agree with this eastern outlook to appreciate the book both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts for whatever your own world ##view a degree of letting go is an art we can all learn refreshing read enjoyed his writing i first read this book as a teenager it has remained on my books ##hel ##f being read many many times i have given it as a gift to several people over the years it is one of my favourite books the prophet is a classic and is considered to be ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns masterpiece gi ##bra ##n himself considered it his greatest achievement originally published in it has been translated into languages and is still a popular piece of literature today the book is a beautiful blend of poetry and philosophy each chapter takes on a particular topic or aspect of life the prophet speaks on love work law freedom pain time and many other important issues we all deal with as we journey through life each beautifully written chapter is also illustrated by gi ##bra ##n the importance and beauty of this book is im ##me ##asurable and timeless this book should be on every books ##hel ##f of those who truly enjoy the beauty of poetry and classic literature to be enjoyed and appreciated by every generation the life lessons offered by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n are timeless in essence and belief probably my favorite book of all time great book this is a combination of a narrative poem and a collection of morality poems the story of the narrative poem is that a wise man ie the prophet al ##mus ##ta ##fa is about to sail away from his recent but temporary home on or ##pha ##lese and he ##s asked to speak on a range of topics so the people of or ##pha ##lese can gather his wisdom before he goes in chapters the prophet expo ##unds on each topic upon which he is questioned topics include relationships possessions laws religion teaching and death the wisdom presented is practical profound and reflects a mystic sentiment ie the idea that the divine is within us rather than something separate this is an extremely quota ##ble volume among his responses the prophet says that one should not be too controlling in relationships that one should not live life under the di ##cta ##tes of fear that its not for one to determine what is moral for another and that one should not engage in morality or worship for show ill keep my review short as the book is tiny and certainly worth your time id recommend this book for all readers i think it has some insight to offer just about anyone i am very disappointed in this book i have always love the prophet by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n and have owned many copies over the years i lent our copy to my sister ##in ##law and just decided to buy a new one this one was described in this way this edition is illustrated with gi ##bra ##ns famous visionary paintings however there are no illustrations i would have not bought this book i may still return it so upset about this a timeless book where ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n el ##o ##quent ##ly dec ##ip ##hers the prophet and words of scripture through a personal way of reflection the context however differing from biblical scripture is indeed parallel to the overall essence of who jesus the messiah known as the prophet or teacher truly was and remains to be iv ##e never read anything that expressed a more romantic view on life if you like elegant poetry this is for you either a poor translation or just pseudo saying ##s this should be given to every graduate or newly ##wed couple you know if you can spell classic you need to read this book iv ##e loved this little book since i was young i am now going to give it as gifts to people i think would like it and could gain some knowledge from it i will recommend this book to every ages this is one of the best book iv ##e read so far full of wisdom ##s that we can apply in our real lives like some other writings this is presented as though by a gifted mystical prophet who has great knowledge actually it is largely con ##vo ##lu ##ted flower ##y language which might ba ##ffle and int ##imi ##date some people the book is only pages long the printed area on the pages is about less than what is available and many of the pages are partial owing to the end of a chapter there are chapters whose titles appear only in the table of contents not in the text the figures in the book are of naked people milling about im sure some people would say im just not smart enough or dedicated enough to wr ##ing deep meaning from this work i say the emperor has no clothes one of my favorite poets and philosophers of all time thank you its a wonderful book a good read id pick this up if your ##e looking for a good read definitely worth the money i never could really put it down i am better for reading this wonderful book i will undoubtedly read it again and again a classic i find new meaning in it every time iv ##e read it over the years beautifully written in gi ##bra ##ns in ##imi ##table majestic style this is by far my favorite book of all time the wisdom is timeless and poetic a true guide for living a life of integrity told through a story of the prophet love it a classic have read re ##rea ##d for years wonderful book book in great condition absolutely my favorite book to read and give as a gift this is a classic i kept a copy at the office and loaned it to anyone who was waiting for someone else the prophet always came back classic spiritual text worth reading as it forms a basis for a lot of contemporary spiritual books a book to come back to again and again depending on your stage of life highly recommend i am spell ##bound reading k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##ns the prophet it is one of those books that a poet writes in rap ##ture when the higher consciousness murmured her sweet nothing ##s too close to a mans ears and he was awake enough to grab a pen and jo ##t down what she just whispered really makes you go hmm ##m beautiful writing it is a comfort to the soul great book real k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n a nice read easy story woven and audience inclusive recommended for anyone willing to be inspired and appreciate nature its easy to see why he is one of the most read poets of all times just beautiful and thought pro ##voking imagery throughout i have read the prophet in bits and pieces over the years but this was the first time i have read it all the way through it does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##unt ##il you come to the end and you realize you are at the end such lovely prose old favorite very calming the name of this book may be off ##put ##ting to those who don ##t want to be preached to however the prophet al ##mus ##ta ##fa does not claim to be the messenger of god or even an expo ##nent of a particular religious tradition rather he tries to show people all the profound depths of their humanity he speaks of the things and experiences common to all family friendship labor houses clothes eating and drinking and so forth revealing their significance the underlying theme of his discussions is unity we are intimately connected to others through our love through work through acts of giving and through our hopes dreams and aspirations even the things that seem to be opposite ##s like joy and sorrow or life and death are the integral parts of the great whole when you grow in awareness of that fundamental connection life opens to you its secrets and you discover new levels of meaning whether you agree with the validity of those concepts you will surely appreciate the beautiful poetic language in which they are expressed this book is a true masterpiece one of my all time favorite books i bought this to rep ##len ##ish my lending library it is a great place to go to when faced with certain of life ##s challenges like death of a loved one not very inspiring these will not work for the purpose that i bought them but i really like the copy iv ##e had for years beautiful this book is ok didn ##t really get that much from it it just might not be a book of good resonance for me a gift that is truly a treasure bought this as a gift the book is a classic and looks like it did when first published which is something i preferred excellent this is one of my favorite books i highly recommend if your ##e considering purchasing this book or if you heard about it go ahead and get your copy i first purchased mine years ago and recently purchased a copy for my daughter this book has great teachings and is written beautifully poetic ##ally and with true wisdom great price takes me back to my post teen youth an absolutely beautiful collection of stories and thoughts my aunt gifted me this book when i was a teen what an amazing book mis ##placed my copy and had to get another everyone should read this book at least once when my novel the trans ##mi ##grant was compared to the prophet i decided to re ##rea ##d it for the first time in years of course the comparison is hum ##bling and i don ##t pretend to agree with the comparison but i secretly hope others will the prophet is a beautiful collection of poetic and spiritual essays more than it is a novel but its a great read nevertheless i read a chapter a day before going to sleep and at times it seemed like the advice was written directly to me its so clearly channel ##ed from the divine universe god whatever you choose to call the source and i will go back to its words again and again everyone should read this book perfect thanks perfect this book seems like it was supposed to be quite the spiritual read providing insight into life ##s everyday mysteries but in all actual ##ity it didn ##t quite fit the bill it has some good points but much of the lines weren ##t all that thought pro ##voking nothing new was learned though others may experience something entirely different if they have no knowledge of the things written lastly the words do run harmon ##iously giving the voice of the prophet a poetic tone classic the message never grows old thoughtful and pro ##voking i h ##v found in the prophet beautiful lyrical language that i often use in inspirational dedication ##s so wrote par ##icular ##ly the chapter on marriage love how poetry the book was in very good condition had this book in high school s finally found this copy to replace my lost one this book was a favorite of mine when i was a young woman im older now i find i have incorporated many of the ideas into my personal philosophy i treasure it because of that i have loved this book since when i first discovered it now i have purchased this copy for a great ##gra ##nd ##da ##ught ##er and i hope she will find it as en ##chan ##ting as i once did a major amount of insight and perspective have always loved his writings i wish i would stop giving away my copies he centers me with his logical way of looking life read this years ago lost my copy and brought another copy just to have when i find good reading material i try to hang on to it one of my favorite books if not my all ##time favorite my mom gifted this to me during a hard time in my life and it really helped now i read through my favorite parts at least once every year its really genuinely beautiful i did not buy through amazon but wanted to leave a review here as well i think everyone should read this book i always plan on having a copy in my home a beloved book wisdom to live by i bought numerous copies to give as gifts a friend recently shared her copy of the prophet and as i began reading i quickly realized it was a reference book that must be purchased and referred to over time very inspirational i read it when im in a down mood as well as an up mood ##e let there be spaces in your together ##ness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls fill each others cup but drink not from one cup give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf sing and dance together and be joy ##ous but let each one of you be alone even as the strings of a lu ##te are alone though they quiver with the same music give your hearts but not into each others keeping for only the hand of life can contain your hearts and stand together yet not too near together for the pillars of the temple stand apart and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow this quota ##tion from the classic book by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n the prophet illustrates why these writings have been popular for so long this reviewer remembers getting his first copy of the book in boston during the early s when it was widely circulated among college students at the time as well as young adults who were starting out in that decade it had a fresh take on the institutions of life and offered that generation a sense of breaking away from convention without being particularly radical it was a way to be non ##con ##form ##ing without departing too far from traditional values this may explain why it surged in popularity in the s when the generation coming of age at that time had a new kind of permission to break away yet have a sense of a valid value system at the same time to read and talk about the prophet became a quite cool thing to do gi ##bra ##ns work had been around for a long time but it is the type of literature that has a way of being rediscovered as each new generation comes along this is at least partially why it retains its popularity over so many years great read short and to the point very interesting perhaps the most wonderful book of how to live a good life iv ##e ever read this must be the th copy iv ##e bought as it is always given away and not returned great product and fast delivery look forward to next time this was a gift my aunt loved it excel ##ent this is a book that def ##ies time it is written with such el ##o ##que ##nce and simplicity convey ##ing messages that are so profound and so real that it doesn ##t matter when you read this book now years ago or years from now it will still be considered a brilliant book with beautifully written passages and thought ##pro ##voking ideas i honestly don ##t know how to begin to review this book when i picked it up to read i didn ##t think i would be so deeply moved by it i thought i might find myself disappointed and let down because of the high expectations i had for it from all the rave reviews it received many people who saw me reading it would immediately tell me that it is their favorite book of all time so i went into it with a little tre ##pid ##ation not wanting to hate it but unable to manage my high expectations anymore it turned out that my concerns were completely unnecessary the book was as incredible as every person i know said it was and as every review i read claimed it was this is a book that may be short but you ##ll want to take your time to read a book that you ##ll need to put down to let the words and thoughts sink in a book that once you ##ve finished you ##ll want to pick up again and again and it will speak to you differently every time you pick it up reading this as a student will have a different effect than when you read it once you ##ve fallen in love than when you read it once you ##ve been married than when you read it once you become a parent than when you read it once you ##ve grown old and that is why it def ##ies time the prophet is a book that discusses life in very simple terms it outlines the important aspects of life and advises us on the best ways to approach them it never pushes too hard and it never turns preach ##y and that ##s the beauty of it i am certain that every person who reads this book regardless of age gender or religious beliefs will connect with it in one way or another in fact this is one of those books that makes for a really good gift to give to friends and family gave as gift i lu ##v this book have re ##rea ##d for y ##rs my library doesn ##t go wo a copy a must read love gi ##bra ##ns wisdom and clarity with words there is much that is lost in translation from the

wisdom on topics ##ab ##out three pages on each gi ##bra ##n writes in poetic prose with a liberal use of archaic words presumably to sound biblical some of the meaning is immediately clear while

the purpose of sentencing and how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their mis ##dee ##ds in the next line i think he is saying that the integrity of the criminal justice

loved it many years later i bought my own copy i had some of the verses on love and marriage read at my wedding there is much wisdom about love life and compassion contained within the framework of these verses i have given them as gifts many many times over the years i bought this copy for a new friend who astonishing ##ly had never heard of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n do yourself a favor and buy

philosophy as it is a great gateway book if i was only able to own one book this would be it i could not get into this book it was all over the place displayed like a children ##s book ##ret ##urne ##d because the presentation stu ##nk great book i took my time with this book to sa ##vor and enjoy every passage for me as a writer and spiritual ##ist gi ##bra ##n was using this story of the prophet al ##mus ##ta ##fa as he walks in the city of or ##pha ##lese as a metaphor for his last journey home he await ##s his ship to take him home the ship that was coming to get him to take him to the next level or plane and he spoke to life ##s journey this is an entire and complete handbook of knowledge as the townspeople come to say goodbye to this wise mana ##nd ask him a myriad of questions as he advises them all about his ideas on love marriage children giving eating drinking work joy sorrow houses clothes buying selling crime punishment laws pain and passion self knowledge teaching friendship good evil prayer pleasure beauty religion and finally death topics on virtually every avenue that life leads us down he spoke with wisdom and truth very reminiscent of jesus the christ and his earth walk as i read other reviews i was amazed at the diverse reactions to this book though not surprised as i myself have had very differing comments about my books ##ome get its ##ome do not very akin to jesus teachings as he walked the streets of jerusalem gi ##bra ##n provides his own spiritual insight and advice on matters of life and how to meet the challenges we all face as human beings a modern day or th century golden rule analogy book ##a handbook to guide and direct the way ##ward soul through its earth walk all of the various town people wanted to hear what he had to say as a wise old sage and prophet ##we so often discount the modern day prophet ##like they no longer exist ##bu ##t of course they do i will return often to the pages of the prophet to gain

children and he said your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of life ##s longing for itself they come through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you you may give them your love but not your thoughts for they have their own thoughts you may house their bodies but not their souls for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which

not knowing what to expect and i was pleasantly surprised not know anything more than that gi ##bra ##n was a philosopher and poet and probably of the islamic tradition i embarked upon what would turn out to be a wonderful piece wisdom literature inspiring in the same way that the very best philosophical and poetic texts can be i found this book to be oddly reminiscent of some of the most inspiring pieces of religious and spiritual texts i have encountered i was surprised to find that it is a near ##con ##tem ##por ##ary piece of literature not a twelfth ##cent ##ury text and i think i got that

stolen several times the words are food for the soul i plan to purchase additional books by this author on children was my introduction to gi ##bra ##ns his insight is simultaneously amazing po ##ignant and very common sense i read it almost years ago at the birth of my first child i was awe ##st ##ruck i call this single poem along with the bible ##my mother ##ing manifesto now that my

deep soul ##ful intro ##sp ##ect while he long ##s to return to his island home awareness blooms that he has made a home in the city of or ##pha ##lese realizing that he has caused himself to suffer by holding himself al ##oft from those in the small community who now occupy his heart he asks himself shall the day of parting be the day of gathering and shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn while waiting for the ship to draw near and al ##mus ##ta ##fa spends his last hour on the mainland he leaves a trail of offerings from his heart and wisdom that he has gained as his gift and final goodbye i love this book so beautiful just like everything written by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n but this one is my favorite i rate the prophet as five stars but this particular edition is not quote as appealing as the old standard traditional version a very good book with many profound statements almost biblical the prophet gives you alternative thinking and a better view of life and death a very good read i gave this to a really good friend as a thank you for a gift i received iv ##e had a copy for years its a great read everyone should own a copy wonderful includes illustrations by the author beautiful book this book was definitely not worth it was only a used and yellow ##ed copy really nothing special about it i returned it happy with purchase this book was purchased to replace one i no longer had i was pleased with timely re either of book and satisfied with condition of it thanks i know the book is supposed to be excellent i have started to read it but just can ##t get into it i keep giving copies of this book away and have to get another i will try to hang onto this one for awhile i came across this at a church sale a summer or two ago i did not know what it was and only read it for the first time a few weeks back as i was reading it i asked myself what is this and who wrote this i thought at times i was reading something from the new testament but actually its quite different as soon as i finished the prophet i started to re ##rea ##d it gi ##bra ##n was a mar ##oni ##te christian who apparently studied many religions he was an artist as is evidenced in the drawings in this lovely edition i read that this book has never been out of print since it was published in i have been greatly en ##amo ##red of the lebanese people iv ##e known they are the warm ##est and friend ##liest people iv ##e come across in the united states so im not surprised that gi ##bra ##n is considered the national poet of that country to sum up the book if such a thing is possible a prophet is waiting for a ship to return him to his home the townspeople come to say goodbye and question him on topics such as marriage children giving eating and drinking work joy and sorrow etc you want to read something up ##lifting read this beautiful book very interesting book about spirituality a most challenging read third time i have read this book and still relevant one of the most amazing books available on spirituality if even that beautiful tapestry un ##fold ##s as the ages are read it is required reading for the people i work with top class writing spiritual truths cuts to the heart of things in beautiful style i have read and re ##rea ##d the prophet numerous times over the years i fell in love with it in my undergraduate days and still have my dog ##ear ##ed and under ##lined copy the prophet has guided me through much of my adult life an amazing thought ##pro ##voking inspiration iv ##e read it many times usually section by section marriage and children have helped me stay sane through a lot of the stuff both of those en ##tail beautifully written classic regardless of your religious affiliation the prophet is worth its weight in gold or should one say wisdom inspiration and the deep philosophy i have read it many many times but did not own a hardcover now i do just one thing i wish we americans would learn to spell the name of this greatest of philosophers right i do believe it is k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n but i guess ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is the name he is known by now i love his writing whatever we may call him a brilliant and thought pro ##voking work a must read it does not matter what religion or denomination you are read this book beautifully written what can you say about this book ##it def ##ies words gi ##bra ##ns view of life death relationships and god are breath ##taking in their beautiful simplicity and deep as a soul i bought it for my year ##old granddaughter and since i had given my copy away many years ago i thought i deserved a new copy of it myself i keep it where i can read a chapter or two whenever the need or the mood strikes me needed new copy to replace s version good book a master of his time ##lov ##ed his thinking fabulous perfect i like the book and would recommend it to people who need to ponder on difficulties in life it gives you something to think about doris came quickly and just as advertised wonderful book one of m favorites since i was a child my father had a copy and i read and re ##rea ##d it many times so happy to have a copy in my own library at last this is one of my all time favorite books iv ##e given this book to a number of people for gifts and have owned a copy myself ever since i can remember i highly recommend this little treasure of wisdom to anyone who appreciate ##s timeless advice from a real master of insight jury still out on this one again one of my favorite gi ##bra ##ns i also bought this for a friend pro ##s beautiful so poetic and creative speaks of universal truth related to the highest level teachings of all religions con ##s sometimes hard to understand due to its old poetic language conclusion a must read for everyone period while there were some parts that seemed a little overly fluffy the majority of the book captured hard to describe spiritual matters with great imagery there were truths in the book so su ##cci ##nc ##tly put and beautifully written below are a few of my favorite you are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth the archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite and he bends you with his might that his arrows may go swift and far let your bending in the archers hand be for glad ##ness for even as he loves the arrow that flies so he loves also the bow that is stable work is love made visible your pain is the breaking of the shell that en ##cl ##oses your understanding you have been told that even like a chain you are as weak as your weak ##est link this is but half the truth you are also as strong as your strongest link to measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frail ##ty of its foam to judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inc ##ons ##tan ##cy and he to whom worship ##ing is a window to open but also to shut has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn your daily life is your temple and your religion whenever you enter into it take with you your all beautiful and en ##light ##ening i had read this book many years ago while living among the mormon ##s in fact it was given to me by a mormon i lost my copy over the years so finding a replacement was great this book is absolutely amazing and is a must read for a great perspective on life this is the book that opened my soul at the age of beautiful i love the writing and consider it my bible great insight and clarity into human behavior touches my so ##u every time i read it this is a wonderful addition to anyone ##s library i truly exceptional man what more can be said great read definitely recommend hadn ##t read it in years what a wonderful rev ##isi ##t reviewed earlier on this page this is an excellent book this book was written by a lebanese christian and published in i purchased two of them for gifts not for a casual audience but if you are into spiritual books and philosophy this is a must read beautiful word ##ing and leaves you with plenty to think about absolutely five stars i was first introduced to gi ##bra ##ns masterpiece when i was a young intelligence analyst serving in vietnam in you may think what an odd place to meet the prophet but actually a combat zone may have been the perfect local ##e vietnam was an area where mans inhuman ##ity to man begged for something that was beautifully expressed and was profoundly true something that was mans greatest achievement in an area of his worst this is just one example of the power of the prophet the prophet is a relatively short book that can be read in an afternoon but its impact will endure for a lifetime i have given copies to friends on the occasion of their weddings and read it to every woman i ever loved i have also recommended it to countless patients in my psychiatry practice one would have to be dead inside not to be moved by the poetic beauty of gi ##bra ##ns carefully chosen words on life love marriage joy and sorrow children and the like it was truly inspired by god himself so profound are its truths this edition is equally perfect it is hardcover and contains gi ##bra ##ns own unique drawings the paper is heavy and softly feather ##ed giving it an expensive appearance appropriate to the value of the writing within it really does make a simple but valuable gift for occasions such as weddings or for others you love if you have never read the prophet then you must buy some copies read one and keep it and give the others away to people you care about after all these years i cannot count the number of times that i have quoted it it is my favorite book of all times and easily garner ##s my absolute highest recommendation famous book very interesting i now have several copies of this book great thought went into creating this book this philosophy timeless classic that has taught me so much your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of life ##s longing for itself i have been a spiritual seeker throughout my life and gone from one extreme to another somehow this book always made sense no matter what side of the spiritual stew ##pot i stood on that ##s the nature of timeless truth my high school english teacher turned me on to it i am eternal ##ly grateful required reading as far as im concerned good x ##mas present interesting read from the last book elvis was reading at the time of his death elvis always brought a copy of this book with him on tours under ##lining passages so i decided to see what the book was about very interesting subject and phil ##oso ##phi ##es beautiful book very interesting this is a well ##ord ##ered collection of ap ##hor ##isms nothing more i encourage you to read it but i do not wish to forward the claim that there is something inherently special about this work it is a loose collection of thoughts on life presented within the context of a very simple one ##act plot i read the book twice to fully digest it its a rich network of thoughts great copy this is one of those books that you can read over and over it is one of my favorites i have quoted gi ##bra ##n in writing letters to people who were moving on people who were in need of comfort etc sheila bi ##cker ##ton excellent book such an amazing book i read this a very long time ago it was i have gone through several copies of it it is most certainly a keeper i kept giving my copies away to friends now i need one of my own again to keep i purchased under the recommendation of op ##rah but this was a mistake i wish i didn ##t do didn ##t really understand the whole book beautiful and peaceful read i carry it in my purse and read it whenever i am waiting for the doctor at the airport etc a great book very helpful in developing a spiritual life i have several similar book but this one is most helpful this is a great book to read again and again i always see new things each time i read it my friends said its a great book but im just not into poetry type books its got good wisdom and life lessons in it though this has been one of my favorite books to quote from since high school i never tire of reading gi ##bra ##n being a child of the s i first read this book in college years later when my daughter went off to school i gave her my well worn ta ##ttered copy of this beloved book recently we have been faced with some health challenges and i turn again to the beautiful words written so long ago by an author with a simply beautiful presence and once again it brings me peace and understanding great poetry great insight great message to current days one of mine top books ever independent of ones creed everyone should read it the prophet is a timeless piece and it speaks for itself the profound messages are written so poetic ##ally and gracefully they res ##onate much deeper than dry philosophy once you read it you ##ll never want to lose this book this is ideal in the few minutes while the microwave is going or you are waiting for the water to boil each takes only a moment to read but gives something calming and thought pro ##voking before you eat or whatever i first started reading prophet in since then i have read it many times each time i read it i have found something new in it its message is ever ##ne ##w this is a book to be read and implemented in life it has made a difference in my life and it will make a difference in the life of anybody who reads it excellent this is one of my favorites since i discovered it in college this is just the ebook version for convenience highly recommended my favorite book i used the passage ##d in my wedding ceremony i read it over and over and never tire of it ka ##hli ##l is so amazing to try to express his wisdom with my own words would be more like an insult just read the book and just let it so ##ak in carl bo ##ze ##man author amazon best ##sell ##ing book on being god beyond your life ##s purpose are you listening addressing the divine within on human being loving and living without purpose the prophet is one of the best books ever written it is timeless provides inspiration and guidance for any situation in your life i recommended highly i purchased to give it as a present and my friend loves it i love it too a classic inspirational for all generations timeless comforting advice with brief verse that one can refer to in the moment a very short book only pages published in to be honest i have no idea why i downloaded this i have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago which i found interesting so it must have been that gi ##bra ##n is described in wikipedia as the third best selling poet of all time behind shakespeare and lao ##zi the book is written in bible ##es ##que so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you on the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today there are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of the prophet by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them returning to his home marriage children giving eating and drinking work joy and sorrow crime and punishment freedom reason and passion pain teaching friendship good and evil prayer pleasure religion death so many of the words written by gi ##bra ##n over years ago must surely if you are tempted to purchase this book res ##onate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change for the better on how you interact with others and with yourself im not saying that i have had a religious or moral ep ##ip ##han ##y while reading this book i personally still have no idea whether i am an atheist ag ##nostic or just a plane old fence sit ##ter waiting for something different or better to come along if that is indeed possible i did write somewhere in regard to the bible and i suppose in the same tone the ko ##ran would be included that i look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it them without the religious ze ##alo ##try and big ##ot ##ry surrounding it them the world would probably be a far better place for all human ##kind but that ain ##t gonna happen but that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written as mr gi ##bra ##ns words i believe fall firmly within that description enjoy editing for kind ##le out reading enjoyment out of plot overall rating out of chapters page length this book has so much you can take out of it to use in your real life amazing and one of my favorite reads of all time i received my first copy of this book over years ago as a young woman i found understanding in topics that concerned me as i aged my life experiences broad ##ened and this book still gave me understanding and confirmation i have given this gift to many and they too enjoy the book and keep it as a reference this is a book that keeps on giving what you need as your life experiences or interests change the garden of the prophet sand and foam is a good ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n story not as strong as the profit or the madman but very enjoyable a short and magnificent book that will forever withstand the test of time because it speaks to and from the heart there is only one thing to say about gi ##bra ##n that he is one of the most powerful writers of gentle soul ##tou ##ching prose and poetry that has ever lived this book is hard to put down because it makes you really think and reflect on life and the world i read through it really fast the first time but i wanted to buy it as a daily reader ##re ##ference to just pick up and read a short section every once in a while this is on the short list of my all time favorite books i have always loved this book and had mis ##placed my original copy so i was happy to get it again i have given away more than of these books over the years and will continue to do so this is a well ##made book will last a long time you ##ve got to be kidding all you star reviewers this overly sentimental trash is sick ##ening it just ram ##bles on and on with nonsense it is said that gi ##bra ##n is a great poet really it has no poetic value whatsoever save your my friend and if your ##e looking for enlightenment try sid ##dhar ##tha have purchased many in the past like in the s after i received one as a gift i recommend to all ages writing this review due to how interesting the book was solitary life of a profit going from place to place educating the world on what he ##s learned and needed to tell them up till i read this book i had an entirely different image of what i profit even is i like the perspective this book gave me i also very much enjoyed the flow of the story well worth the read it has helped to replace the many dysfunction ##al premises my socio ##pathic parents modeled this is a book with a popularity which continues to grow at phenomena ##l rates i had to buy this version since id lost my original classic one there certainly need to be more half price book stores here in ca i got spoiled by having in dallas alone this is a timeless classic over the years iv ##e given it as a gift more times than i can count and will continue to do so addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us re ##ex ##amine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives so easy to read over and over reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water cool and quiet in a moss ##y gr ##otto its direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in leaving you at peace it is best to set time aside for it relax absorb and let it softly clear your mind i bought this book to supplement a recording i treasure in my collection the prophet is truly inspirational and poetic ##ally illustrates the many challenges and journeys the human spirit traverse ##s from birth to death the utter ##ings are om ##ni religious and subtly explain the basic principles of the human lifespan from an authoritative and spiritual perspective a must have for any deep or not ##so ##dee ##p think ##er i have known and loved this book since childhood and give it as a gift to the special people in my life this book provides a reflection that you can apply to your own life and a way for you to try and assess whether you are truly doing the right thing and making the most of your short time on this plane this is classic reading which i did read when it was young i was glad to find it available for kind ##le who can ever say anything negative about this great philosopher poet artist read enjoy and apply to your own life wow i gave away my previous version of this book which was in paperback i am so happy with my replacement this was in great shape there was no writing except for a small inscription which was just a name at the front i love it i love the prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need its message i don ##t ever loan mine out because it never comes back this book speaks on all matters human iv ##e owned it since i was and go back to it constantly i especially love the sections on children love and marriage its a wonder insight ##ful read and i highly recommend it its also rather spiritual which is lovely its not like the bible but easy to read and take in it can give you peace when you need it please consider adding it to your library the language is poetic but it is not poetry it works as prose poetry in fact some of the best in english that is probably because gi ##bra ##n somewhat mimic ##s the poetry of the king james version some phrases and turns and images are brilliant that said what is the point of this book there are some nice things is not religion all deeds and all reflections who can separate his faith from his actions who can spread his hours before him saying this is for god and this is for myself this for my soul and this other for my body good point there are several such nu ##gg ##ets but you can tell why the hip ##pies ##et loved this book it is spirituality devoid of religion namely this book can make you feel all cosmic without all that pe ##sky christian morality that bit quoted above it is followed by he who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked ah see what morals get you on crime and punishment we get this it takes a village gem and as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree so the wrong ##do ##er cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all see crime is not the fault of the criminal it is the fault of society the righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked ye ##a the guilty is often ##time ##s the victim of the injured see if you self ##right ##eous rich folk didn ##t op ##press the meek poor folk they wouldn ##t have to commit crime i wonder how the injured rape victim victim ##ized her guilty rap ##ist generally the twin cr ##edo ##s of the prophet are any path to god is the right path and if it feels good do it thus the plural ##istic re ##lat ##ivism of lines like say not i have found the truth but rather i have found a truth say not i have found the path of the soul say rather i have met the soul walking upon my path forget that jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man comet ##h unto the father but by me john by the way no no no many will ##fully ignore that jesus said such une ##cum ##eni ##cal things like this the hip ##pie ##je ##sus thinks that there are many paths to god the whole one source many wells philosophy don ##t believe me why do you think the folks at the jesus seminar black ##ball ##ed this very verse john our great loving hip ##pie ##je ##sus believes that everyone comes to god in his own way he would never say that black ##ball that last quota ##tion wasn ##t an actual quote by the way and though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort ##of love thy neighbor philosophy it still defines good not as following ju ##dae ##och ##rist ##ian morals or even a do unto others prescription but you are good when you are one with yourself if it feels good to you do it sure gi ##bra ##n later seems to warn against un ##bri ##dled pleasures ##ee ##king pleasure is a freedoms ##ong but it is not freedom it is the blossom ##ing of your desires but it is not their fruit later however such he ##don ##ism is considered a path a truth to god some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all and they are judged and re ##bu ##ked i would not judge or re ##bu ##ke them i would have them seek thus the paradox of liberalism the prophet re ##bu ##kes you for re ##bu ##king those he ##don ##s amongst you they are only on their path you are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong ah re ##lat ##ivism the problem with un ##che ##cked he ##don ##ism you are good when you are one with yourself if you prefer is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions man always finds a way to make pleasure ##ata ##ny ##cos ##t devoid of anything else his god i don ##t want to seem as if i am some stick in the mud a pr ##ude or an over ##moral ##izing and self ##right ##eous christian christian i am and he ##don i sometimes am i can get wheat from the cha ##ff out of the prophet there is much here that is good and some of it is art ##fully written some of gi ##bra ##ns thoughts are even profound still there is much here that is bad there is still some shu ##ck on the ear so to speak sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path but there is just one right path not several gi ##bra ##n never seems to say that and since he was a lebanese christian i find that sad there is much here to lead you as ##tray i will not hold it against gi ##bra ##n that the prophet has inspired numerous imitation ##s of lesser ##po ##etic talent sad pu ##r ##vey ##ances of even fewer truths yes i am speaking of amongst others the tri ##te ina ##ne ca ##co ##phon ##ies of paulo coe ##lho and for those reviewers and readers who think that the prophet is the most poetic most en ##light ##ening most cosmic ##ally spiritual tome of all time try reading the psalms in the k ##j ##v with an open mind yes i invented the word he ##don he ##don ##ist sounds like a philosophical school as does epic ##ure ##an the latter too is for an ae ##st ##het ##e lets say a he ##don is a pleasures ##ee ##ker without the philosophy a he ##don is an un ##sop ##his ##tica ##te i probably made up that word too just re ##rea ##d the prophet for the um ##pt ##een ##th time still love it and its insights into many issues great quota ##ble texts everyone should read this and reflect ##not the same as agreeing ##on what gi ##bra ##n says maybe some of the folks in his homeland considered him a prophet but i see him as an other person with some ideas but not too many truths that being said i like many of his ideas and concepts if you like spiritual guru ##s like ec ##khar ##dt toll ##e you ##ll probably like ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n i have been a huge fan of the prophet since i was and received it as a gift that was years ago it is one of my favorites to open up over and over and over ro ##xie since i first read the prophet when i was a teenager i have had a copy by my side it is a gift of such value in comprehend ##ing the depth and meaning of this wonderful life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us be it work parenting eating death or love gi ##bra ##n paints word images of such divine and exquisite love ##liness that once read will change the readers perspective forever it is a book to refer to again and again as life un ##fold ##s and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness it is a book i have given as a gift to many young people as they gr ##apple with the frustration ##s and distortion ##s of an often inc ##omp ##re ##hen ##sible outer world it is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls i particularly love this edition which includes gi ##bra ##ns original drawings i admire the philosophy of this author this book is age ##less and inspirational should be one of those mandatory books for high school i haven ##t read this for years but at one time it was very meaningful to me simple suggestions for life this was a book that my wife read and loved we purchased this one as a birthday gift for our daughter and had it shipped directly the seller was very prompt and even agreed to add a birthday note with the shipment great seller experience i bought this book for a friend since i am a christian i cannot accept anything this book says i think the book would be a great aid for hollywood writers to put a movie script together this book has been a classic for many years it has so much wisdom in it that it can be read numerous times and new things will come out each time my favorite chapter is the one on children one of the classics that everyone should read it is also one of the most profound books that is this short i have loved this book since i first acquired it decades ago ##a classic in every since of the word i have always kept a book copy had to have an eco ##py too i plan to buy this book ##and a few others ##tha ##t i had a long time ago to write a better review i would need to ref ##resh myself on eastern or middle eastern mystic ##ism ##pers ##ian more specifically ##su ##fi ##sm and also the background of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n what i can say is that these small stories or para ##bles or fable ##s are zen ##like thought ##pro ##voking and ins ##truct ##ive i loved this book when i read it and i wrote one of my still best poems while i was in the state of mind this book put me in im positive it was just after i turned because i have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a friday night football game in the distance from the high school ##and not wanting to go to another football game because i had to free my friend from the outside port ##ap ##ott ##y after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out ##and naturally my claus ##tro ##phobic friend started screaming and freaking out she did the same thing i would do anyone of any age can enjoy this book ##i just wish i had a copy around so i could ref ##resh my memory and do a more detailed review of course im sure i would have read it more than the one time i read it if i did have the same copy i had when i was a teenager i always read books i really like more than one time this book and the little prince by saint ex ##up ##ery ##si ##dd ##hart ##had ##emia ##n and steppe ##n ##wo ##lf all by herman hesse are books i read at the same time period and that i also don ##t have anymore ##eit ##her because i gave my copy to someone ##or ##had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away or ##the ##y just went the way of all things ##as things goin time and my th birthday was quite awhile ago ##si ##gh has also gone the way of all things ##bu ##t not completely anyone who likes the prophet or any of the other titles i mentioned can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read ##or who has one of these books on their books ##hel ##ves ##or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature its a beatles thing not so much connected to the beatles but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more ##w ##hen their friends like the same type of music that they like beatles zeppelin ##pin ##k floyd ##ro ##b zombie black sabbath or gods ##mack ##or johann sebastian bach ##writing or music ##its still art and we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own aesthetic magnet ##ism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit ##and everyone is in love with their soul ##mates ##to have common ground or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the in ##es ##cap ##able movements of the mundane anyone reading the prophet ##and finding themselves on common ground with the author ##wil ##l find gr ##ati ##fication ##and will know exactly what i mean in what i wrote in this short review deep moving dramatic verses of the heart and soul truths of ancient wisdom from a true and romantic poet relevant for all eternity this is a fantastic book and i would definitely recommend it to everyone quick read but also very insight ##ful it really makes you think the prophet is a story of advice from a departing visitor to the villagers of the town where he has resided for the past years some is moving some is ordinary a bit is tri ##te some parts are powerful this version of the book is truly outstanding because of the beautiful illustrations that accompany it all reproduction ##s of famous pieces of middle eastern art a fantastic book i highlighted or wanted to highlight almost every word so much beautiful metaphor and profound wisdom here i wish everyone read this and took it to heart i had this book for years lost it when i moved i got this used was glad i did felt like getting my old copy back i have loved this book for years so i bought enough for my whole book club to share it with them the writing is wonderful and stimulate ##s thought charity and love and better actions towards ourselves others and the world slow reading but full of significant messages took long to read in order to fully capture and understand his message i have read this book several times i have given it to loved ones several times there is much to learn about life and love from reading this book it has always been a classic for a reason this book was great each chapter was a nu ##gg ##et of wisdom resulting in a treasure tr ##ove by the end its no wonder this book is called a classic gi ##bra ##n uses a literary style inspired by the bible but it is still easy to read has a lot of philosophical ideas that im sure i will rev ##isi ##t in the future seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you re ##rea ##d it definitely recommend especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read an amazing work realizing extensive use of biblical imagery and sentence structure the prophet by k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n is a literary classic influencing the free love movement of the s gi ##bra ##ns master work explores themes of love longing and loss i have not read the book from cover to cover but read s ##ni ##ppet ##s and what iv ##e read so far is up ##lifting and en ##light ##ening when i married years ago the minister quoted from this book and i thought it was a little corn ##y but iv ##e heard it used at all kinds of events since and i find its stood times test portions are quoted in my church ##s ceremony for de ##dic ##ating children and i turned to it for a toast when my daughter married recently i was sorry to find the hardcover out of print but i bought this copy for her and her husband its a keeper true to life then as it is now classic forever used marriage passages in my wedding ceremony ##nee ##d i say more i read this book many years ago it is a book that should be on ones book shelf to read often it takes several readings to get to the heart of his deep writings of philosophy glad i replaced the one i lost excellent book full of wisdom even though the book wasn ##t preach ##ey there were a lot of references made to the bible made just read it its one of those books that will renew your idea of humanity i would recommend it to anyone one of the best books written in english ever simple yet extremely penetrating like jonathan livingston sea ##gul ##l deeply thought ##pro ##voking like stranger in a strange land semantic ##ally precise yet as moving as the psalms of david gi ##bra ##ns masterpiece is timeless the prophet is one of the best books i have ever read i have read it many times and each time it seems more rich i think it makes an excellent gift each time i read this poetry i see another aspect of life at i can never stop learning ##par ##tic ##ular ##ly loved the piece on children a book of poetry i go to when i am ponder ##ing different subjects always very calming to read his beautiful wise words i just love this book its deep philosophical romantic and a beautiful add to any book collection it makes for a wonderful gift the prophet was a surprisingly quick read that gave me quite a bit to think about during my travels this summer ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n has a talent for words and it really shows would recommend to anyone interested in poetry philosophy or human relations ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is a wonderful poet he is a philosopher who mesh ##es the bible with his prose very spiritual to read this is a wonderful book by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n it takes you back to a different time and place which is pleasing it is a comfort book relaxing your spirit the seller was prompt with delivery i have loved this book for forty years both the written version and the audio richard harris na ##rra ##ting i believe with orchestral accompaniment this new format only increases its accessibility decent read i read for myself to find out what the fuss was about nothing major not too impressive just a decent read i guess i can now say that iv ##e read it when i hear people talking about it the al ##chemist by paulo coe ##hl ##o was wa ##aa ##ay better truly a classic of world literature gi ##bra ##n has snatched a chunk of wisdom from the ether ##fr ##om and for the ages ##and fashioned it into a master ##work the prophet is a poetic in some aspects means of viewing life ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n was able to draw on various aspects of life and com ##pile a take that is in some senses new and app ##re ##cia ##ble not to be confused with the good book typical eastern philosophy and good food for thought i liked this book i thought it was inspiring i bought this for a child going through a stress ##ful time i always took comfort from it when i needed a few words of wisdom and needed to appreciate what i have i love this book and give it as a graduation gift every year they like the message i buy a minimum of each year i was referred this book to read and enjoyed it reading it slow is the best way to absorb it fully i find myself quoting this book constantly this is a nice book to give as a gift because it covers such a range of life topics and has such wisdom to convey i also find myself referencing its knowledge when providing advice to friends its an absolute classic that calm ##s your spirit book offers amazing phil ##os ##phy and at the same time delivers perspective on any thing life the prophet is a must read your joy is your sorrow un ##mas ##ked and the self ##sam ##e well from which your laughter rises was often ##time ##s filled with your tears and how else can it be the deeper that sorrow car ##ves into your being the more joy you can contain page great book great price i read this book quite a few years ago this reasonable purchase from amazon ##com afforded me to rev ##isi ##t the reading of this book it did not cost me an arm and a leg either loved this book since first i read it years gone by purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read gi ##bra ##n a classic which has only improved with time the thoughts and ideas in this book would make the world a better place an old book that i had read many years ago but had lost decided to buy again and get inspired its worth the read i have loved this book my whole life it is one of the books i turn to in all the details of life i have no memory of buying this book but i had it when i was a kid and loved it maybe i should buy it again i have no idea where it is now [UNK] what else can i say lo ##l very goo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##od read i hope you enjoy it i bought paper back and it came fairly quickly thanks beautiful ##y written book and as you read it again over the years you find more and more meaning in it great read a book for the ages each little piece of prose ##po ##em has something simple and profound to tell us all i received my first copy of the prophet a million years ago when i was a somewhat pre ##co ##cious year old i still have that copy now i find young people who i believe will benefit from these writings and pass it along probably best first offered at ages and certainly at any age beyond i must admit i don ##t understand the new cover the original was so much more appropriate thankfully the text remains intact gi ##bra ##n has been quoted so often that to some parts may seem oddly familiar like an over ##used catch phrase however in context gi ##bra ##ns thoughts remain utterly profound like biblical text that one reads and re ##rea ##ds one is challenged by the understanding ##s that gi ##bra ##ns writings promote and that can only be achieved through experience over time definitely a treasure ##d companion this work still holds up decades later every reflective thoughtful person should have the prophet in the home library it can be read one chapter at a time the chapter on love is as good as anything iv ##e ever read ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n touch ##s the heart the soul and the mind beautiful words that comfort and guide if only more people would read his work if you can call it work wonderful writing but the publisher as many seem to do these days get very artistic and print too faintly the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read it isn ##t the writing its the publisher at fault the printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word is to let people read it the prophet is one of those books that you refer to often over the years and to have it on my kind ##le so i can take it anywhere is a real treat this is a nice text of ap ##hor ##isms separated by leaf ##y diagrams inside the text also includes black and white original paintings by gi ##bra ##n on individual pages k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##ns work is always outstanding and this is one of the best from what i have read its also a nice size hard ##back and not very long but very deep and revealing in dec ##eptive ##ly simple lines i think these hard ##backs are some of the nice ##st volumes of gi ##bra ##ns that have been printed i would rank sand and foam as one of his best this is one of few versions of this book which was available through amazon prime which included all the normal book contents check my other reviews to help you identify the two of that i ordered which were incomplete the true real book is won ##d ##we ##ful and you need one but make sure you don ##t order or give one as a gift which is incomplete dan ##c please don ##t order this particular publication of the prophet it is a poor reproduction which is missing one of the most important components the table of contents this is a book of prose with very close ties to each of the chapters listed in the contents it will be very disappointing to purchase a copy without the reference to each chapter and its title look at my other warnings as this is the second of different versions which amazon prime has sold shipped to me with this missing component the original book the prophet is price ##less but it is very important to have the table of contents ask amazon for specific ##s and make sure the book is in its original form dan ##c this book is a very poor copy of the original and is missing at the very least the table of contents in this book each verse of prose should be separated and numbered listed clearly in a table of contents in the front of the book this publisher and amazon neglected to proof read these copies and are selling you an incomplete book warning do not order this book its value is highly reduced without having a contents for quick reference so as to aid in quickly turning to a relevant chapters poor for sharing or for personal comfort very sad indeed sincerely dan ##c i couldn ##t be happier i had this book many years ago and lost it and this copy is in almost perfect condition i lost my own copy when i moved some years ago and decided i just had to have a copy of my own again its so beautiful in its descriptions of life have had this particular book for many years i have given it to family and friends especially young woman for me it put life in proper perspective and especially helpful when both my children moved to europe think there is something for everyone residing in my mind are the words of a true poet i was given the book the prophet by my best friend when i was young it has followed me through my life and has filled me with the emotions and practical thought i needed to guide me through the smooth and rough waters of my life i gave this copy of ka ##hil gi ##bra ##ns book to a young lady with the hope she will enjoy it the rest of her life thank you amazon for having this wonderful work of art available to all this book isn ##t the truth this book is not the word of god this man was a son of a pastor but worshipped a profit not god do your homework on him the bible is the truth don ##t be mis ##led by what this book tells you this man was a son of a pastor but worshipped a profit not god do your homework on him the bible is the truth don ##t be mis ##led by what this book tells you this quote is from wikipedia thompson reported gi ##bra ##n later saying that all the way through writing jesus the son of man he thought of abdul ##bah ##aa ##cute years later after the death of abdul ##bah ##aa ##cute at a viewing of a movie of abdul ##bah ##aa ##cute gi ##bra ##n rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an ex ##al ##ted

baha ##ac ##ute ##iac ##ute faith for one who would prefer truth coming from a source other than the king james version the prophet is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry if there is a black and white truth one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses i had this book before and lost it when i moved and i just love it touches my soul and gives me perspective on life such a classic book deep wisdom in a very read ##able container the prophet has always been a favorite and i wanted to give a copy to my brother the book is great for just picking up and reading a page or two i had the opportunity to read a passage at my wedding ceremony i am happy to add gi ##bra ##ns classic work to my personal collection recommended reading for everyone book arrived in perfect condition a wonderful book full of beauty meant to be read over and over you will need quiet around you to let all his words absorb ju ##bra ##n ka ##hli ##l ju ##bra ##n had a teacher make a mistake on his name and wrote down ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n as when he arrived here from lebanon which was still part of the ottoman empire he went by gi ##bra ##n ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n his poetry is as timeless as his view towards life and the world at large everyone was his friend one passage half of what i say is meaningless but i say it so that the other half may reach you was used by john lennon in the white album on a tune called julia i discovered the prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then now in addition to my beat up hard copy i have a portable eco ##py if you were looking for an example of an intelligent ##ly designed pun intended book of spiritual guidance this would be it it doesn ##t care how you picture name or define god or whether you give him a gender and a personality it just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others if jesus and the buddha teamed up to write a book it might come out like this when i first read it i found some passages difficult to grasp looking back i now think that it was not because they were hard to understand but because i did not want to hear gently spoken intelligent ##ly phrase ##d ideas that contra ##dict ##ed my own now if i could have only one book this would probably be it read the prophet in college and now my college kids have discovered it in fact my daughter and her new hub ##by used quotes in their marriage ceremony fun to red ##is ##co ##ver and share the book this is a book i wanted in my library my original copy is yellow ##ed and worn this is the one book other than the bible that i continue to re ##rea ##d this is an amazingly beautiful book the writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful they cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring poetic and though ##pro ##voking words in answer to questions raised about them when my mother passed away i read this book over and over again many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows my daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony i cannot think of a better way to spend you will more than get your money ##s worth even if you only read one chapter in the book this was my favorite book when i was so i purchased it for my y ##r old granddaughter hope she loves it as much as i do great writing about children being sons and daughters of life longing to be themselves this was a great chapter for my sons i stumbled onto this book and it opened my mind and began my process of becoming aware then i went across country to collect my deceased grandmother ##s belongings one item was this book i opened the the cover and saw that grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it one person who had signed it was my mom who had died years before before my grandma im going to buy it for my little arrow now th generation of passing it on this book trans ##cend ##s all religions and explains the many questions we have about life through what seems like a channel ##ed spiritual source this book is not long but says so much is so few words highly recommended needed to read this and could not find my old copy so bought a new copy and it still helps me when i need to remember what is inside this lovely collection of wisdom i read this book when i was and years later i still go back to this book all the time and have memo ##rized most of the passages the prophet changed my life i was pretty amazed to find a garden that sits across from the vice presidents house in washington dc honoring ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n and the great work he wrote obviously i have not been the only one transformed by his messages the first one was the masterpiece while this book is just the wrap ##per the bulk of gi ##bra ##ns truths are in the original prophet great book i shared with my cow ##or ##kers and haven ##t gotten it back yet so everyone at work is enjoying the book as much as i did and the self ##sam ##e well from which your laughter rises was often ##time ##s filled with your tears and how else can it be the deeper that sorrow car ##ves into your being the more joy you can contain is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter ##s oven i first came across this in a high school class on the spiritual journey and its remained by my side ever since gi ##bra ##ns poetic graceful writing touches upon issues central to human life a deeply moving work that i cannot recommend enough wisdom for life a true manual to help you on your spiritual journey i think gi ##bra ##n has peered into the human heart mind ##and soul his advice is profound i gifted it to my son who enjoyed it as much as i did when i was in college many years ago i found this book years ago and have loved the way of life that is described within its pages its the perfect way to live for all humanity no matter ones personal beliefs as to the none ##xi ##sten ##ce of god it covers all face ##ts of life and its wisdom is ind ##is ##put ##able be aware ##the drawings done by the author are all nude ##s in this edition they are taste ##fully done and very artistic not a problem for me but i bought the book for an acquaintance and am not sure how they will be received here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again this book sub ##scribe ##s to no particular religions but gives much to reflect upon this is a short book it will only take you around an hour or so to read it but if you want to take a break from the he ##ctic day ##to ##day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life this book is for you its the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom they ask him questions about life and he gives them deep spiritual answers simple concept great read the prophets words are full of wisdom passion learning and moreover peaceful for a loving or depressed soul you won ##t be tired of listening to his calmed recorded voice thanks this book is so good it brings tears to my eyes in the beauty of the word ##ing it is definitely a must ##rea ##d for everyone who enjoys reading his words are so poetic and philosophical gave me reason to pause and think loved it i frequently quote gi ##bra ##n many great quotes in this book if you enjoy his work this won ##t di ##ssa ##point might not agree with every idea but the writing is haunting ##ly beautiful and nos ##tal ##gic read it outdoors under a tree in the fall or spring read it aloud enjoy for years iv ##e seen the prophet sitting on others book shelves with the haunting face on the cover and i always wondered what this book was about then a friend laid it in my hands a few months ago just at a point in my life when i could actually grasp it i read just one page and gi ##bra ##ns words were so beautiful so powerful so truth ##ful that i had to get a copy of my own al ##mus ##ta ##fa the main character is a prophet of god he is christ buddha krishna the higher self he is the familiar soul that walks between heaven and earth in all humans and all creatures as he is about to leave the city of or ##pha ##lese to return home the people there sorrow ##fully beg him to share with them his wisdom one by one they ask al ##mus ##ta ##fa to speak of love of children of eating and drinking crime and punishment of houses and self ##k ##now ##led ##ge among other basic topics of life his answers come in precisely crafted poetry that is dec ##eptive ##ly simple stunning ##ly beautiful and potent in their spiritual depth af ##mus ##ta ##fa ##s responses to the people of or ##pha ##lese represent the di ##sti ##llation of gi ##bra ##ns own self ##master ##y his own unified consciousness and spiritual awakening this short book should be read slowly and repeatedly until all its hidden truths are unveiled even if it takes re ##rea ##ding it years after the first time it is not only gi ##bra ##ns masterpiece but his loving gift to the world im glad it took me years to get to it i would not have appreciated it until now _ the prophet _ is a short read my copy checks in at just under pages but its be ##re ##vity bel ##ies both the power and beauty of gi ##bra ##ns words at its simplest it is a discourse on the human condition love work joy and sorrow crime and punishment reason and passion gi ##bra ##n runs the ga ##mut of emotion and being laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings while the tone is somewhat mystical which i didn ##t really care for the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me for example in the chapter love gi ##bra ##n writes when love beck ##ons to you follow him though his ways are hard and steep and when his wings en ##fold you yield to him though the sword hidden among his pin ##ions may wound you and when he speaks to you believe in him for even as love crowns you so shall he cr ##uc ##ify you even as he is for you growth so is he for your pr ##uni ##ng the contrast vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life and the choices iv ##e made it would be going too far to say that as a result of reading the prophet iv ##e had an ep ##ip ##han ##y or to take it to a ridiculous conclusion some sort of a conversion rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical

##late what you read good source of tran ##quil ##ity im not religious but i take moral philosophy very seriously if there were a list of books that all people should read in order to call themselves a student of life this is probably the most important one i would also include the al ##chemist check it out i have been reading the prophet every year for over a decade or intending to its an incredible read if im having issues in my life i read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat it is a divine ##ly inspired piece of work and can be read in one setting there is pretty much nothing that he doesn ##t cover in the book that can ##t be related to your own life i bought the ebook version so i could have easier access its a book for everyone cool book i really like the quality of the production black cloth ##bound with gold em ##bos ##sing and nice paper looks to be cotton rag i am proud to include it in my collection int ##rigue ##ing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living very read ##able the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insight ##ful is revealed it is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life the language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a sur ##mon by jesus i give it stars i considered giving only stars because the format is fairly predictable but i have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end ##and then start over for that matter excellent for busy people or commuter ##s a decade past i knew very little about the writer ##art ##ist ##po ##et ##pro ##ph ##et ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n i am happy to say that today i am well acquainted with his work the prophet was the first book i read written by gi ##bra ##n and ever since that first reading i have immersed myself in his extra ##ord ##ina ##rily con ##sum ##mate skill of exquisite ##ly crafted words to say the prophet or any other writings by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are med ##io ##cre i recommend that if you have not touched upon any of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns books that you consider the prophet as a good start you will not be disappointed a few other extraordinary works of art by gi ##bra ##n the voice of the master the beloved sand and foam the broken wings between night and mor ##n the earth gods and one of my personal favorites though not so much a story but rather a collection of personal letters to dear ##ly beloved friends ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n a self ##port ##rai ##t i just love gi ##bra ##n i have most of his writings it took him years to finish this little book and it is so spiritual not religious it is a book of love i highly recommend this work to everyone got this book for my son who wasn ##t familiar with ka ##hli ##l ga ##bra ##n everyone should read him at least once don ##t you think the book was more attractive than pictured and small fits in his pocket he likes it this is an excellent short book of inspirational fiction by one of the best poets of all ##time i especially love the artistic cover of this well made paperback edition iv ##e read this book a few times and it always takes me away from the petty worries of everyday life to a place where universal truth seems to exist this is surprising as i don ##t believe in universal truth but in a world of competing truths depending on your perspective how does gi ##bra ##n do this its the simple poetic language and use of metaphor which makes this book seem timeless some people have said he ##s helped to inspire the arab spring and that he ##s a revolutionary others say he ##s irrelevant and full of pop psychology but he remains the third most popular poet in the world so go figure another book i read recently had a similar prophet a woman called bal ash ##tu calling for equality between men and women in islam it was called mosaic deception ##s i think worth a read too if your ##e interested in spiritual themes and a good plot in the same book great service great condition i loved the prophet and didn ##t care for this book at all it didn ##t res ##onate with me and i didn ##t understand it most of the time quick read not moving had this book in the s and not sure what happened to it but always recalled many quotes from it so was happy to find it again first time with this company and will use them in the future this book remains simply the best i have read it many times and quoted it frequently over the last years i gave a copy to my daughter as part of her wedding gift and years later it is at her bedside the information given is simple yet profound it is something that ex ##ha ##ult ##s when you are need to be lifted up comfort ##s you when you are dish ##ear ##ten ##ed and provides something for nearly every situation as a nurse i carried one with me always and shared frequently with patients who found comfort in the simple poetry you will want to keep it handy its appropriate for most situations and makes a wonderful simple gift i first read the prophet in college back in the s the book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent s it had a profound effect on me and became a book i always took with me after graduation i joined the peace corps and during stress ##ful training in country liberia at times of illness and the night before i left this book gave me great comfort i read it before i married just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses i am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future gi ##bra ##n offers timeless insights and love with each word i think that we as a nation should read and learn the lessons here it is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through my friend recommended this book she said she had read it as a young girl and it made an impression so i bought it for my son i read it and loved it the way the book is written is so sweet and beautiful the explanation to lives basic spiritual rules are poetry i loved it my friend renee gave this to me a few years back and asked me to read the prophet i started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because i tried consuming too much sorry my normal is history historical fiction and either sci ##fi or fantasy after all this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch slowly sa ##vor ##ing the flavor having let things slip a little longer than intended i started reading it again this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing the impact on me this time things flowed somewhat better for me the individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone while i don ##t always agree with mr gi ##bra ##n philosophy for a subject some are particularly moving for me in particular his passage on joy and sorrow was border ##line earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two describing to me why both can be so strong rating this one is extremely complex some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have others flow over you whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later because i wasn ##t touched by all i call this a very strong star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a star book what i can say though is thank you renee for exposing me to the prophet iv ##e always loved the prophet and iv ##e read it many times i gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement i purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book if your ##e looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you if your ##e looking for a real book then this is a joke the book came in great condition as well as on time feel sad though because it was lost in a move a book to be treasure ##d a tremendous poet dealing mostly with christianity and spiritual love his insights on topics of life are to be cher ##ished i have read his treasure ##d poems many times and brightened the lives of others by sharing this book was highly inspiring during my emotional spiritual journey to discover my biological roots i listed the prophet as a key reference source in my book adoption detective memoir of an adopted child judith land author adoption detective memoir of an adopted child this is an excellent book it arrived in good shape i have loaned it out to other people they are as ##tou ##nded that it is a used book i read the prophet years ago as a freshman college student wished id read it in high school the lessons in this book can really positively impact the life of a teen or young person iv ##e found another book that is geared towards young people that also gets this same message across in an epic adventure way that teens like the prophet ##ic tales of no child left behind i stumbled across this book decided to buy it for a niece that ##s a senior in high school its very rough with some errors but the impact it had on her life was similar to the impact the prophet had on mine if you like ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n i think you could appreciate this also i have this entire series in the original but nothing is quite so good as this one a wise master is leaving the city as he depart ##s the crowd shouts out for him to imp ##art his knowledge teach us about love education power knowledge etc they cry a simple plot for the organization of timeless wisdom received on time and thank you for re ##l good on time service his chapter on pain is the best i plan to buy more copies from amazon for my departing son distant friends last night i made a mad dash to get a copy of this book ten minutes before the book store closed because i couldn ##t find my old one i had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an so ##s to a lifelong friend whose comforting presence i really needed even if just by phone long sun ##lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with year old oaks magnolia ##s elm ##s and maple trees did not make me feel any better at home the news is only reporting the political and eco ##mon ##ic turmoil going on worldwide or the oscar ##s the latter which i could care less about it was a very sad and lone ##y moment back in miami i would naturally hit the beach or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world so in desperation i jumped in my vehicle hit the book store and called on the wisdom of mr gi ##bra ##n i sipped a glass of red kicked back on my couch and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present i don ##t know why but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end in little over an hour id read slowly through each page and felt better on physical inspection this would be the student slack ##ers paradise book report choice but don ##t be so easily dec ##ei ##ved because this book packs more useful information than any pound college textbook without the endless verb ##age of a page russian novel it is small the paper of good weight and quality the ones i always purchase at least the print is big and the illustrations done by mr gi ##bra ##n are simple yet human ##a and di ##vin ##ical the words are brief and powerful comforting and idiot ##proof perfect healing food for the loves ##tar ##ved yet attention ##de ##fi ##cit crazy world we now live in i was first given this book by a friend as a departing gift for a lands ##ea voyage back in i hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me i sent this book to him as my comforting presence the prophet is a powerful book of topical wisdom by lebanese author and poet k ##hal ##il g ##hi ##bra ##n the book begins when a fictional prophet arrives mysteriously by ship and is taken in by a group of people who he remains among for several years before he leaves he wants to thank them for their kindness but has nothing to give so he gathers the people together and answers their questions with his wisdom on various aspects of life the premise is similar to that of the tao te ching and lao t ##zu imp ##art ##ing his wisdom to a guard every chapter is beautifully written in simple yet profound prose balance and the one ##ness of life are big themes g ##hi ##bra ##n is so art ##ful in his use of metaphor ##s and doesn ##t waste a single word if ever there were a great gift book this is one i think its a classic that everyone should read once but most will find themselves returning to many times over the years easy read interesting book i bought this book on a chance of luck really enjoyed it i recommend it to everyone i turn to the prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track this book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living and does so in a creative thought ##pro ##voking way i first learned of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n and the prophet during a sermon at a unitarian universal ##ist church and i ran to get the book its occupied an important place on my books ##hel ##f ever since it helps me realize that life is a process and letting go is a big part of moving forward it also reminds me to be mind ##ful of how i think about and interact with the world it keeps things in perspective the prophet is an inspirational read k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##ns book the prophet has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release what a blessing that it exists each passage touches on a deep and universal topic marriage friendship etc the words spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insight ##ful prophet who has nothing but words of wisdom to imp ##art to those who gather around him is a truly life af ##firm ##ing and transform ##ative experience please read this today it will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world iv ##e been a fan of this wonderful book since my college days back in the dark ages it contains many wonderful thoughts that will always inspire hi i have not read the book yet but it arrived on time in the condition i expected beautiful wholly accessible brought tears to my eyes as graceful as jesus para ##bles must have been when freshly spoken without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations the prophet had been on my list of oh yeah iv ##e heard about it and probably should read it one day books a friends recommendation bumped it from there into my kind ##le this is the book that motivated me to learn how to under ##line and save notes the kind ##le e ##qui ##vil ##ent of dog ##earing my favorite parts somehow less satisfying than a dog ##ear but really easy to retrieve later other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely un ##rea ##d because they are just too much work i probably won ##t read don qui ##x ##ote for example until im sitting on the spanish med and polish ##ing my classic spanish easy and good for you how perfect is that this book takes different themes such as work love etc and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man who seems to be spirit talking he is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embrace ##ment of all dark and light he is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his open ##ess and alive ##ness he wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity this can be read in a variety of ways coming from each persons belief system i read this when i was in a state of loss loss of so much this book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time it can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings i most def ##inate ##ly recommend this book for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life everyone carries an om ##ni ##fi ##cent quality within themselves some individuals have not grasped this concept some individuals do not realize that a simple change can create a huge transformation would you ask an important figure for advice before she or he left town their advice would be elements about life that you already knew but seemingly forgot there are simple fundamental ##s to follow that can make you a better person within your own eyes gi ##bra ##n uses the prophet al ##mus ##ta ##fa to en ##light ##en readers with simple tactics they can use to live a more pure and genuine life how many of us love go to work have clothes feel pain and own friendships you do not have to be religious to appreciate this book gi ##bra ##ns classic takes common stress factors that everyone can relate to and shares guidance on how to sim ##plify it in your life when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself and to one another p read this book and share it think about the most valuable portion to you in this book share that portion with another person this is a book that i purchased for myself many years ago it is as current today as it was when i purchased it ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##hn is able to capture the thoughts concerning all aspects of life and relationships that make good sense of what life should and could be now this is a must read kind of book simple yet very deep makes you look within yourself and realized what you are doing with life and what you can do better highly recommend it to anyone looking for insight of self and spirituality i had read this many years ago and had forgotten how truly inspirational the prophet was poetic ##yes ##dee ##ply moving di ##tto thought pro ##voking definitely this is a classic that im now very happy to own this should be on the book ##list for every child before graduating hs the textbook of life my year old thinks so too the prevailing popularity of gi ##bra ##ns prophet lies in only one secret he writes his poems with readers in his mind the compassionate poet i come to know through his lines gi ##bra ##n did not write to impress shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty the prophet addresses essential subjects of life that concerns everyone love freedom children work self ##k ##now ##led ##ge friendship time beauty death to name a few i have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripe ##ns with time and each time you take a sip it still surprises you with refreshing revelations also recommended are his less known books a tear and a smile sand and foam and the garden of the prophet i didn ##t really know what to expect when i purchased this i knew only that it was a well ##re ##gard ##ed book and that it was said to be full of wisdom what i found was a story that was easy to read there are few words per page covering the saying ##s of a wise man as he speaks to those around him there is a kind of poetry in the words but not the kind that is difficult to understand the insights were both familiar and refreshing it made me rec ##ons ##ider my notions of all aspects of life although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening i bought the hardcover it is small and sits easily in one hand the pages are made from a rich ##fe ##elin ##g texture ##d paper that feels nice to the fingertips and the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters throughout the book are scattered drawings that ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n made i like them i feel they add to the experience of reading this book although i can ##t quite put my finger on the reason while spiritual it does not as far as i could tell convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god gi ##bra ##n says the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass pp the notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a per ##vas ##ive connected ##ness or one ##ness with nature and the universe this is a wonderful expression of some of the fundamental truths of human nature and existence this little book is always on my desk and every now and i rev ##isi ##t it again and rum ##inate over the wisdom

my top ##ten favorites of all the books i have read iv ##e purchased many copies for gifts for others and never travel without my own worn but wonderful copy sorry for late response delivery and state of product was perfect thank you kind regards melissa it was my mistake to assume the book would come with a book jacket which it didn ##t despite the picture of it however pages are intact and came in decent condition i evidently mis ##rea ##d the write ##up i thought it was a hard ##back it was a cheap paperback i got it as a present so i couldn ##t send it back but im very di ##ssa ##point ##ed for the cost gi ##bra ##n may be a poet rather than a true prophet but the simple truths in this book seem applicable to all religions the short passages on love children pain beauty death and other timeless topics are full of insight and inspiration but completely lacking in the politics and self ##right ##eous ##ness that per ##va ##de so many religions this book is goodness plain and simple and it changed my life more than any other book i can recall reading my intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading rather than the timeless content the quality of which is well known i very much enjoyed paul spare ##rs reading i found his rich bass voice and el ##o ##quent style ideal for gi ##bra ##n and very pleasing to listen to unlike another reviewer i was not at all distracted by the music in fact i barely noticed it taste in such things is a personal issue and for what its worth this reading very much suits my tastes the excellent condition and speedy receipt of this product will always encourage me to purchase items from amazon and their providers wonderful the book is fine yet i would not have purchased this version if i had known that it lacks a table of contents particularly for the prophet most readers want to be able to jump quickly to a particular section i want to return this version and buy a more expensive copy that includes a table of contents being brand new to the kind ##le i will now see if amazon allows a kind ##le item to be re ##tr ##une ##d for credit the prophet by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is a book that ##s been around for a while there are many passages in the book and many basic topics on marriage children friendship work and pleasure which will touch you in one form or another the subjects are timeless i especially love the reflections about children marriage and love in order to be understood the book should be digest ##ed slowly and thoughtfully like watching an olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n is in many ways ind ##es ##cr ##ibe ##able in that way its good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving an ##ect ##odes of how it personally touched them but ultimately those an ##ect ##odes are like the stories of people who ##ve gone to some great vacation spot sure they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or app ##re ##cia ##ting its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there because of the way this book is written some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word i wish we could award more than five stars i wish it could be an infinity ##for every heart touched by this wonderful wonderful book i would buy from this seller again ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n was a genius the prophet uses a lot of old english but is still an easy ##qui ##ck read i can see why this book has been translated into dozens of different languages definitely words to live by a poet first read this when i was years old now several decades later i just re ##rea ##d this while sitting and waiting during karate lessons and other children ##s sports ##act ##iv ##ities it brought me back again to the mountains of idle ##wil ##d above palm springs where i first read his words while at church camp it brought me back to that place of center balance and peace profoundly wise and insight ##ful ##i loved the way his words washed over me filling all of the corners of my heart would recommend this to all lovers of words and soul seekers ##of any age this is age ##less and price ##less thanks ka ##hli ##l for another lovely visit i love this book his writing seems to just flow from page to page i get something different from this book each time i read it gi ##bra ##n was a great author and in this book he truly shine ##s i recommend this book to anyone even if he ##sh ##e is not into reading the book is short but full of wisdom i only gave it stars because the idea of the book and even the title are taken from thus spoke za ##rath ##ust ##ra which i gave stars so i didn ##t think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading i actually recommend both books but the prophet is much easier to read while thus spoke za ##rath ##ust ##ra is deeper and more intelligent i keep a copy of this book nearby at all times for quick reference my personal copy home to numerous marks and marginal notes every line reads as the most delicate of poetry hon ##ed and refined to the pure ##st and most und ##enia ##ble words of truth and wisdom this may be the height of human understanding bringing a peace and solidarity which encompasses the many to make us all one this book is tagged as the prophet by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n ala ##s i know im easily annoyed but i didn ##t even open the sample of this book once i saw that the title and author were in all caps im sure the text is fine but i didn ##t bother to look i bought a different edition instead these days ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns the prophet often gets dismissed as hip ##pie literature yet this book had been a bestseller long before the s originally published in it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the great depression today gi ##bra ##ns claim to fame is being the third best ##sell ##ing poet of our time behind shakespeare and lao t ##zu and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book when his publisher alfred kn ##op ##f was asked who the audience for the book was he flip ##pan ##tly dismissed the question it must be a cult he retorted yet there is no such cult what ##s incredible is that there ##s absolutely no marketing h ##ype behind the success of this book gi ##bra ##n himself is long gone there is no political religious or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and ##or profits the gi ##bra ##n estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word ##of ##mouth and chance discovery the fact is the twenty ##si ##x poems in this book have a surprising and su ##pr ##ass ##ing relevance insight and compassion broken down into several topics on love on work on joy and sorrow etc the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland i first found gi ##bra ##n through a setting of his poem on children by local washington dc singers sweet honey in the rock on their album breaths your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of life ##s longing for itself they come through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you at the time i was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parents roof had made me restless for autonomy that poem el ##o ##quent ##ly expressed everything i was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent ang ##st it later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where i needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me i am not ex ##agger ##ating when i say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most tr ##ou ##bling times in my life our modern lives are ever he ##ctic stress ##ful and busy wrought with drama frustration depression etc the knowledge in these poems brings me back to a middle ground there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in un ##wind ##ing and coming back to earth they bring me back to a place of clarity from w ##hc ##ih i can see my life from a wider perspective though gi ##bra ##n himself was a christian and despite the title and con ##ce ##it of the book this is not really a religious book the insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist what ##s more the poetry is mostly im ##agi ##stic do not expect the academic poetic ##s of gi ##bra ##ns contemporaries eliot or pound or even frost they are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphor ##s and vivid imagery copies of the prophet are not hard to come by perhaps check out the books table of contexts either using amazon ##s search inside feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with that ##s a good a place as any to start with chances are you will find something that speaks to you on some level i appreciate getting the book at the great price im really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places it looked like it was on the shelf for quite a while ##ma ##ure ##en a very profound deeply insight ##ful and moving experience one of my two favorite books of all times no matter how often you read it you find something new some new insight some amazing revelation some word of consolation another stunning example of word ##craft a masterpiece inspired this book should not be on a book shelf in the library office or study but on the bedside table and the audio ##book on your ipod should we could we all walk through life in such an en ##light ##ened state what a wonderful peaceful world it would be how can we deny that ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n was directed by the

i could read the original text the simplicity and frank ##ness the blend of respect for the individual and appreciation of spirituality ##thi ##s is the most astonishing work i have ever read i was introduced to gi ##bra ##n by my husband on my birthday years ago since that time gi ##bra ##n has helped me in many of life ##s trying times my favorite passage is by and far his writings on children how many times during the teenage years of raising my son did i turn to his reminder ##s on how to be a good bow i don ##t know but it was in ##val ##ua ##ble help i give this book to graduates friends who have everything friends who have nothing after a trauma in their lives there really isn ##t any op ##por ##uni ##ty that i pass up to give this book as a gift with a message included that i hope that they can find as much in this book as i have don ##t try to read it as a book ##its able to be read from any point and any topic that strikes your fancy and by all means go back and re ##rea ##d you will find new and fuller meanings with every reading i read this book when i was and was amazed and en ##light ##ened by its simple wisdom years later and with a bit more life experience i still am in awe of the truth contained in the pages of this book one of the most profound books i have ever read you can learn al ##ot about love life and relationships after reading this book very insight ##ful when i first started writing poetry at age or i was encouraged to read other poets something i refused to do because i thought it might influence my style ok so i was hard headed i later was introduced by a brother in law to ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n and it was like finding a kind ##red soul i now totally encourage any one that wants to excel in poetry to read the great ##s and you won ##t find many of the caliber of this man his words sing from the page both in his poetry and in his short stories i love martyrs to man its been a while but some of the words are still sing ##ed in my brain and i think it truly speaks of the time we are living in now more than ever from memory so not verb ##ati ##m are you a soldier who must for ##sa ##ke wife and children and go fourth into the fields of battle for the sake of greed which your leaders mis ##cal ##l duty than you are a martyr to man there ##s more but the gi ##st of what i am saying is if you love poetry and you haven ##t read any ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n your ##e missing out on one of the greatest poets to ever live and if you write poetry i firmly believe ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n should be rec ##qui ##red reading not that you will feel you have to pl ##od your way through it you too will fall in love with his immense gifts sincerely and best wishes to all chase von your chance to hear the last panther speak as you read gi ##bra ##ns poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you gi ##bra ##n is just ##ly famous for rich metaphor ##s that brilliant ##ly highlight the pursuit of truth and goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature i read this about a year ago and can ##t recall a great deal of the book from what i do recall it was like a poem all the way through while the writing was beautiful i found it ambiguous and be ##fu ##ddled with meaning that i could not identify with when gi ##bra ##n speaks of god i cannot identify because i have since abandoned those phil ##oso ##phi ##es it is thus difficult to rev ##isi ##t them in this book i have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book indeed i pulled wisdom from parts but rather than go back and read it again for now perhaps i will move on to another of the many books out there that are en ##light ##ening and worth reading someday i would like to read this again and dig deeper anyone who has read gi ##bra ##ns book the prophet should read the eye of the prophet while the first book is the masterpiece of phil ##oso ##phic poetry this one is its great companion in prose both books pre ##scribe philosophical view on love marriage death beauty things and topics that en ##ci ##rcle all of our lives and experiences the best thing one can do it to have both of these books as a tools to use and reflect in times of need doubt and inspiration i have read the hardcover copy of the book i wish that hard ##co ##py edition of the book had as many illustrations by its author as the prophet but ala ##s we only get to enjoy the one on the cover for readers new to gi ##bra ##n it is helpful to know that he was a wonderful painter in addition to his excellence in writing i recently read an article in the new yorker magazine about ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n writer born in the middle east to christian parents ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n managed to im ##mi ##grate to nyc with his mother and siblings gi ##bra ##ns personal life and his early death his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece the prophet it is a mystic story written in verse less than ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting the book is a manifest on how to live love work dress embrace joy and sorrow accept righteous ##ness and mankind far from perfection it is a book of dual ##ity that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life no matter what world culture continent or country one comes from ##thi ##s verse is universal if anything this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of gi ##bra ##ns work i need to get into a mind of this wonderful think ##er who himself led a very complicated and solitary life it has been a long time since i read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature this book could easily be a text for religious and non religious people to live by great remarks on death love life or anything check it out a brilliant mans philosophy on love marriage joy sorrow time friendship and just life originally published in translated into more than languages also has drawings by gi ##bra ##na poetic inspiring little book that you can read over and over again this is by far the most inspiring work i have ever read the

father when i was a teenager it is a gift i hold dear to this day over years later it is thought pro ##voking the truths are as relevant today as they were in the early s the prophet for me is a very vivid yet dense book it speaks some sort of wisdom and i delight in that wisdom when i can understand it the illustrations are done by the author himself which is nice i am almost years old when i was and deeply conflict ##ed weighted down with the confusion ##s that can only be so imp ##oss ##ibly painful at that young age my mother gave me a hard ##back copy of the prophet iv ##e carried it with through all these years as a treasure ##d companion it helped me make sense of the nonsense my life was back there in and its comfort ##ed me more than a couple times in the years since then as well today im here at amazon to buy the same book for my year ##old daughter she ##s a bright warm funny sweet girl who is undergoing no small amount of ang ##st as her com ##fy girl ##hood world slips away her friends have begun to sc ##atter to the winds ##some to college and some to jobs ##and her own collegiate and adult responsibilities lo ##om ever taller why she ##s asked me why do i feel so sad i have no reason to be so sad ##bu ##t i am why and my mind flashed to your joy is your sorrow un ##mas ##ked and the self ##sam ##e well from which your laughter rises was often ##time ##s filled with your tears and how else can it be so i want this book for my wonderful daughter i think she ##s ready for it and most of all i think it will help the turmoil in her soul as it did for me when i was her age and for my mother before me and let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing this book still holds all the philosophical magic years after gi ##bra ##n wrote it he managed to di ##sti ##ll some basic truths about life and they are as applicable now as they were then i bought this book for my son who had his stolen from him and was in despair he likes the beautiful poetic resonance and in looking through the book i agree this is a book for sensitive souls beautifully written and illustrated by the author the prophet by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is a very beautiful inspiring writing which really res ##onate ##d within me it felt as truth i feel that with good patience and deep con ##tem ##pl ##ation this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you i first read about ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n in a book called ##nb ##sp ##the lost teachings of atlantis that book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of life who and what we are and more in a very easily understand ##able manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n i highly recommend reading that book also maybe i just wasn ##t in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one mans life phil ##oso ##phi ##es but this book lost me after the chapter on children some sections are insight ##ful and very well written on death children and love were my favorites im not sure how novel these ideas were back in when the book was first published but they are nothing new today still the flower ##y language is pretty its not overly long and also its probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop so its not all bad this book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the s and s it occurs to me that the prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation peace love and all that crap you know maybe its just not relevant to me maybe i need to approach it at a different time maybe i need to smoke something herbal ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n the lebanese ##ame ##rica ##n poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this volume his master ##work had he written nothing before or beyond the prophet he would still be remembered into per ##pet ##uity each brief chapter of the prophet addresses an aspect of the human condition including love marriage work pleasure buying and selling children eating and drinking to name but a few gi ##bra ##n es ##po ##uses no particular religious ethical or moral system and yet includes them all in this slim tome written it seems with a qui ##ll of light not ink a higher power by whatever name you may call it spoke through gi ##bra ##n in the writing a perfect letter to the ages and an ultimate expression of humanity ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns the prophet is a singular book clearly inspired by a higher power by any name we wish to call it the authors qui ##ll was dipped in light not ink as he wrote such is the substance of what is written on the page the simple elegance of the language of the prophet very much lend ##s itself to public readings and there have been many audio recordings of the prophet released over the years this is one of the more un ##rem ##ark ##able ones reader paul spare ##r has an impressive ste ##nto ##rian voice but his habit of inter ##ject ##ing unnecessary roc ##oco flourish ##es in his speech det ##rac ##ts from this recording the prophet needs no such flourish ##es he also reads too quickly giving the listener little time to absorb the words nor does this recording need the inconsistent moments of flute music between chapters especially as the playing is both shrill and tune ##less more consistency and less stride ##ncy and perhaps some lu ##te notes might have added to this recording rather than diminished it this recording comes on cds split very uneven ##ly a better quality product could have this book entirely on one disc the reading and packaging is merely average the material however is not three and a half stars for the cd five by five for gi ##bra ##ns genius seldom has there been a book that i have read time and time again as much as this one i have given this book numerous times to people as a small gift i have used this book in my sons christ ##ening when he was a baby and on numerous holidays these words are every bit as relevant when they were written for all time this book still ranks in my top this is the second book by this author iv ##e read it gives insights into our every day lives i found a lot of quota ##tions id like to post on the walls in the classroom where i teach all the writings of k gi ##bra ##n carry a deeply spiritual information his teachings are very tightly inter ##twined with christian values i highly recommend this book to understand and open our knowledge of christian religion all over the world this was purchased as a gift to a friend who had just lost a dear friend and i was pleased that she found as much comfort in his words as i and my family have for many years a must have for any home library this is an amazing book of poetry ##eve ##n if it is written more like prose it is definitely one of my favorite books and i think that gi ##bra ##n defines what the word poetry means in his writing of this book definitely written with the divine hand i like it better than rum ##i or ha ##fi ##z this book is for anyone of any religion i was first introduced to this book at the age of and have every word memo ##rized i refer to his words daily ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##ns serene nature gives light to the words of the prophet and will touch you iv ##e always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom and attempting to package them in tidy market ##able portions for mass consumption however i found this novella unique and un ##pre ##ten ##tious in its delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life it was a well ##written thought ##pro ##voking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life my mother read this book a long time ago and recommended it to me but i never read it i just recently ##u read in june and glad i finally did this book short essays on the different aspects of life these are teachings and they are meant to inspire and advise they are written in such a way so that the words are not rammed down your throat it is a true masterpiece in which almost every if not every word counts i have read it over and over again since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before i left for berkeley to attend law school i have given copies to many friends and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully there is enormous wisdom in each chapter especially given the material ##istic and secular world in which we live which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual under ##pin ##ning ##s gi ##bra ##n cuts through to the beauty and essence of life and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century this book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what life is really all about indeed it can be picked up at any age and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written i urge anyone who is thinking about buying it to do so just peru ##se a copy at a local bookstore or library and you are apt to become en ##th ##ral ##led it may take several readings to so ##ak up its essence and even after many years i still find nu ##ances and learn more each time i re ##rea ##d it if your ship has run aground and you are looking for inspiration to continue your journey this book is for you sen ##su ##ous seductive and profound this poetic beauty is nectar for the gods a prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland which he misses why he is there why he is waiting how he knows what he knows and who he is is a mystery as he depart ##s the townspeople gather to wish him well a local

much more it is a profound work and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself you were born together and together you shall be forever ##more you shall be together when white wings of death sc ##atter your days aye you shall be together even in the silent memory of god but let there be spaces in your together ##ness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls fill each others cup but drink not from one cup give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf sing and dance together and be joy ##ous but let each one of you be alone even as the strings of a lu ##te are alone though they quiver with the same music give your hearts but not into each others keeping for only the hand of life can contain your hearts and stand together yet not too near together for the pillars of the temple stand apart and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in

##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n was born in in what is now northern lebanon in he went to paris to study but he did not like the strict education and so he traveled eventually moving to new york gi ##bra ##n became both an artist and a writer and in he published the prophet which is generally considered to be his greatest work he died of cancer in a new york hospital at the very young age of the prophet is a story about al ##mus ##ta ##fa the prophet who after living years in or ##pha ##lese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home before he goes a group of people stop him and to them he teaches the secrets of life gi ##bra ##n writes in a very poetic manner and it is wonderful to read anything iv ##e read by gi ##bra ##n is in my mind flawless this the most famous of his works is no exception it is simple yet deep honest and profound moving and inspirational gi ##bra ##ns work is one of a kind and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self ##hel ##p program or therapy or anything like that the poetic style the ap ##hor ##isms the para ##bles the almost biblical feel are all just what over ##work ##ed overs ##tres ##sed modern and spiritual ##ly starved world ##ly people need this is a very beautiful book it contains a lovely section on marriage em ##pha ##zing the importance of sep ##erate identities between lovers gi ##bra ##ns prophet is the best example of how simple prose can be used to convey deep and powerful statement as the name suggests the book just recounts some sermons given by a prophet the themes discussed include love family friendship

very useful ##l book that can be used as a secondary source for your primary religious texts not only does it give you excellent prophet ##ic saying ##s but when reading anyone could have a di ##ff ##rent interpretation here is some things you could look to find your pain is the breaking of the shell that en ##cl ##oses your understanding say not i have found the truth but rather i have found a truth say not i have found the path of the soul but rather i have met the soul walking upon my path for the soul walks upon all paths you talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts for what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and th ##urst and beauty is not a need but an ecstasy who can sep ##erate his faith from his actions or his belief from his occupation to judge you by your

be alone in his knowledge of god and his understanding of the earth have you ever read a line first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought even a reality hits you and even after you have finished the message keeps playing on and on in your mind well this book is one of them if you have luckily found other books by other author it is the exploration of self soul community nature and universe no matter what religion you hold from where you came or who ##w ##hat you are this is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday the prophet is a supreme literary achievement that has impacted millions of people around the globe the prophet has been translated into many languages and has sold millions of copies gi ##bra ##ns chef ##do ##eu ##vre will provide the reader with an ec ##static refined and trans ##cend ##ing literary experience i picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n this is a brief text written in a flower ##y language that masks some simple points i did not find this book inspiring or insight ##ful but it was a short read at least out of stars the deeper that sorrow car ##ves into your being the more joy you can contain is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy there is insight and wisdom on every page years after someone first lean ##t me a copy it seems to have more relevance to life ##s fundamental challenges than ever ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n tells the story of alma ##sta ##fa ##s departure from the city of or ##pha ##lese as he leaves the prophet alma ##sta ##fa shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience your pain is the breaking of the shell that en ##cl ##oses your understanding work is love made visible and think not that you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course however the prophet is much more than a few inspiring self ##hel ##p quotes more a case of some of the deepest eastern wisdom universally applicable to the human condition long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world this book was recommended to me by a friend what he told me of it is that just as the art of war this is the book from which you take out whatever you want what you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you it speaks of love life and people in the most touching way ever i have it in my hand ##bag at all times when i first read it i cried there is literally something mystical about it i like to think i took a lot out of it one of those books you should read again and again and again this is one of the best most inspiring philosophy ##po ##et ##ry books ever written i have read it over and over though never tire of it it is a great reminder for what ##s most important in life and puts everything in perspective my favorite chapters are love marriage children and the first look i am a romantic though so the other chapters may appeal to you more absolutely classic and timeless perfectly stands the test of time my personal copy is from and is one of my favorite treasures this book was the first and only iv ##e read by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n every chapter offers insight and philosophy on almost every subject that a person can think about from death to love to marriage to friendship ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n offers a very sensitive view of all aspects of life iv ##e re ##rea ##d it many times its a thin book which has deep thoughts about topics like love generosity death prayer etc it can be read again and again because it is thin while at the same ##time it contains so many words of wi ##sd ##on my father has this huge book collection and i remember i was around when i found this book amidst a sea of books and i thought it was pretty small so i read it in one sit ##it changed my life it talks about life love friendship death etc all of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for ##are in this book it tells you all of these things that you already know about life but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don ##t have to do the right thing as if ignoring them will make us more human by default there is no place that i go that this book doesn ##t follow me i remember in college having this teacher that i despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn i said the prophet by ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n and she got all excited too and said that ##s my favorite book too its like my bible ##i remember thinking how can i have something that is so important to me in common with someone that i des ##pis ##ei guess that ##s the thing about life ##i will never forget that or her i originally read this early in college and didn ##t think it was anything special then i saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks so i bought it it took about an hour to read there were about a dozen short passages i under ##lined most of them weren ##t really revelations but rather really good analog ##ies i liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths re ##mini ##sc ##ient of the bible but universal in its appeal advice on how to act and live and believe this book was written in but is timeless in the wisdom of which it speaks i would recommend this book as a gift for someone you know who is going through times of difficulty or ad ##vers ##ity no matter their religious beliefs if i have ever read a book that is timeless other than the word of god it would have to be this one although i may not have agreed with every word written so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me i read this book many many years ago i quoted from it at times and thought of it often the words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need there are not many books that can stake that claim and i have read many a classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated recommended i was given this book by a writer friend who called it the most beautiful book iv ##e ever read so since she and i have similar literary tastes i was inclined to read it this little book written in a rich colorful deep and wise poetic style is full of some of the most moving and impressive spiritual phrases and messages iv ##e ever read it was written in but its poetry and wisdom are timeless david re ##hak author of poems from my bleeding heart this is a book you can read and re ##rea ##d many many times great and timeless thoughts about relationships love and friendship i will share this with my family jeffrey c mca ##nd ##rew author of our brown eyed boy gi ##bra ##n wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it the importance of each relationship the book was written to be re ##lat ##able to every reader all the subjects are mon ##dai ##n the availability of this book is a great advantage that i don ##t think people are aware of its an hour long to read but a lifetime to understand if you read it you ##ll remember it in every new life matter or relationship buy it and keep it on the she ##l ##ve for reference its an answer to everything and read it carefully this book is everything that is simple delicate true and beautiful i have read few books so touching and en ##light ##ening the prophet is a true masterpiece that has that feeling of ancient wisdom in it the wisdom of the text is gentle yet insistent it lets you understand things you ##ve always known my feelings def ##y description reading a classic such as the prophet is much more fruit ##ful when it is revisited often the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if gi ##bra ##n is writing only to him or her sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from gi ##bra ##n listening to him speak the accompanying art work also by gi ##bra ##n gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer listen embrace and breathe in these words open your mind and heart to the prophet great little book full of seemingly common sense should be read by any judgement ##al person or re ##li ##go ##mani ##c should be cheaper k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##ns the prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of pro ##sai ##c poetry despite being a native ##born arabic speaker gi ##bra ##n wrote the prophet in english ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation the works short chapters rec ##ount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey the words that flow from the prophets mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatise ##s on all aspects of life chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as on friendship on pain and on death what unite ##s the chapters is gi ##bra ##ns thought pro ##voking and probing literary style as gi ##bra ##ns prophet in ##vo ##kes his listeners to live life to the full ##est the book is not over ##tly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity the book is eminent ##ly quota ##ble with every chapter providing a nu ##gg ##et of truth worthy of repeating amazingly gi ##bra ##n packs his masterpiece into less than pages making it a very quick and easy read readers will find themselves returning to the prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of gi ##bra ##ns words the prophet which gi ##bra ##n himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece is a timeless literary classic its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so i was given this book as a high school graduation gift and i have found it to be the book i look to in hard times as well as good times for advise inspiration hope and words of wisdom i highly recommend it mr gi ##bra ##n has beg ##ets a master piece his sp ##len ##dor writing style is amazing and the el ##o ##quent use of the words are moving force which forever will be a guiding light for our souls i read it in an hour ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is definitely the peoples philosopher the book itself seems to be written on impulse and the author knows what the modern world is looking for the context is powerful and sensitive and more than anything its the truth pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life very simply this book speaks to everyone it doesn ##t matter who you are or what you believe it brings tears to me each time i read it because if your mind is open you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading i hope you will take that understanding and in ##fus ##e it within all you do i also recommend listening to richard harris reading of this book though it may be out of print these days a timeless classic it is a very demanding and assuming title but gi ##bra ##n backs it up with some excellent style and content if he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier he could have inspired a new religion from the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it it is

regrets it is a book that includes such beautiful metaphor ##s and velvet ##ty language that you are always sucked into reading just one more section what makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the authors statements but also the beauty of his words the flow of his language i hate to be like everyone else in more instances than just this but it does change you it states what any

##bra ##ns words strike as deep and sudden as lightning and lay bare to you with unbelievable simplicity the truths of human life and they do so beautifully to read this book is to en ##rich yourself en ##light ##en yourself and to enjoy some of the most beautiful words ever written gi ##bra ##ns accompanying drawings are as mystical and moving as his words and accent ##uate the utter ##ances of the prophet the sheer wisdom and beauty of this little book is und ##enia ##ble all hail the prophet the prophet di ##sp ##ense ##s ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well k ##hal ##il gi ##bra ##n defines all that i never had words to define or more appropriately did not have the good sense to define i discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since i refused to rush through it i read it a lesson at a time understanding it to the best of my ability i found a way of life in these words i could read it everyday and each time these words would di ##sp ##ense a new lesson like a never ending treasure certainly the words are of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n but the eternal ##ly present divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words this is one of the five most valued books that i keep on refer ##ing again and again for sol ##ace and peace of myself while writing or rather while being an instrument to write this book ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to human ##kind gi ##bra ##ns book is music poetry wisdom and truth all at the same time i salute ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n for giving us the the prophet this belongs in every spiritual persons home library easy reading on easy spiritual truths intrinsic ##ally this book utilizes a flowing a cl ##ea ##ver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author while personally i found nothing profound in the id ##eo ##logies expressed in the book i did find it simply a pleasure to read even with the lack of philosophical ep ##ip ##han ##y the style of the book in its fluid manner the parallel structure of the chapters and the br ##ev ##ity combined with the larger font in the piece leave the reader whether they agree with the phil ##oso ##phi ##es there ##in or not in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time as really they probably have not it really did not waste my time anyway it only took a little over an hour to read with breaks i would have to say that this is the best book iv ##e ever read i could feel every word deep in my heart every ##time of the many times iv ##e read it i would never get enough of it its a treasure i can ##t think of a title fitting enough what can you say about a book that you believe to be one ##of ##aki ##nd i have yet to find a book that i can compare it to i suppose i could at least explain why i find this book to be so unique first of all this book covers most all of life ##s complex issues in the simplest fashion and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation secondly and astonishing ##ly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people but i cannot be so shallow to think that i am reading a said story i am not reading the said story ##w ##hat is actually happening is that i am the listener and ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is the prophet himself i strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself you are probably reading some other book i think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading in fact with that said i can state with confidence that many readers will peru ##se only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling you may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered you may feel regret like i did i regret not having this book earlier in life to help me i believe that a great many of you will feel amazed it is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life ##s puzzles there is a quote from the ur ##ant ##ia book that is appropriate in closing this review the quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings i received from this incredible story and that quote is the argument ##ative defense of any proposition is inverse ##ly proportional to the truth contained and i give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth i am a firm believer that if ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n is not a modern day prophet no one is and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity i cannot think of anyone who would not love this book when gi ##bra ##n was first introduced to me i had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary grab a dictionary sort of read but when you first open to those sections that apply to you and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears well shock is the only word for it yes the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in the prophet may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed unique iv ##e purchased countless copies to the ones that i know will love and understand his words and if for nothing else ka ##hli ##ls work can be labeled as truly a literary work of art gi ##bra ##n gets right down to the bedrock of what it is all about he was obviously a very en ##light ##ened man and the prophet is so completely psychological ##ly and spiritual ##ly healthy anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living is simply simple ##mind ##ed this book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life i first read the prophet about years ago and i typically read it about once a year just to remind myself however i gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being at risk at age i believe the book had a significant positive impact on him and he is now and living a very responsible and balanced life after my son had read this book i found him on the telephone one evening reading passages to a friend it made him think and any time you can get a teenager to think its a very good thing when i ordered this book i knew it was worth it the prophet teaches us about life with its pains sorrow ##s joy and love and much more this book deserves more than five stars i highly recommend it i first stumbled across gi ##bra ##n in a quote a fire ##nd shared with me while i was going through a divorce the quotes on pain joy and sorrow and love became touch ##stones this is a very touching per ##ceptive work this book was given to me as a gift before i journey ##ed overseas on a spiritual quest to find myself i never got a chance to read it until one month after i was there and i had lost my job my relationship was very un ##stead ##y and being so far form home i felt completely isolated after skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately per ##tained to me at that point i cried not out of sadness but out of enlightenment ##gi ##bra ##n wrote his experiences ##and his thoughts on life but they are such detailed poetic accounts it applies to everyone at some time his writings have layers and therefore this book can be read many times over and each time a new understanding will come your pain is the breaking of the shell that en ##cl ##oses your understanding its a thin book very read ##able and has interesting page thoughts on various entities like anger children religion speech silence and its cool ##rea ##ding of ##co ##urse if one needs to im ##bib ##e the thoughts of the author it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you pretty head ##y and clear about certain things this is one of the first literary books i recall reading my mother kept a collection of gi ##bra ##ns works that she often read i was curious to see what attracted her so i looked into them too i was either eight or nine at the time i believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed at the time more relevant than what i was being force ##fed by nuns in cat ##ech ##ism class re ##rea ##ding gi ##bra ##n now im struck by the notion that hesse must have been aware of these texts before he wrote sid ##dhar ##tha they contain many of the same themes no one else can guide you on your path you must select your own course preacher ##s and prophets are a dime a dozen true wisdom comes from within the prophets teaching on love is particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life for even as love crowns you so shall he cr ##uc ##ify you even as he is for your growth so is he for your pr ##uni ##ng even as he as ##cend ##s to your height and caress ##es your tender ##est branches that quiver in the sun so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth like shea ##ves of corn he gathers you unto himself he th ##resh ##es you to make you naked he si ##ft ##s you to free you from your hu ##sk ##s he grind ##s you to white ##ness he kn ##ead ##s you until you are pl ##ian ##t and then he assigns you to his sacred fire that you may become sacred bread for gods sacred feast look into these books they may appear sim ##pl ##istic to the ja ##und ##ice ##d eye but they may also provide the inspiration you need to see you through life ##s tr ##ava ##ils this book is almost as if ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n took the pains and joy ##s of millions of people and somehow managed to en ##cap ##sul ##ate all these wonders in this one book in his own unique manner gi ##bra ##n has explored every face ##t of human existence although the book has a sacred charm to it there is a universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious per ##su ##ass ##ion enjoy this gem of a book i wouldn ##t be surprised if a few hundred years from now some theologians une ##arth this book and conclude that it was a bible of our times if there were more than five stars this book would surely deserve it this book is the paradigm of wisdom hum ##ility and grace this is my favorite book on my shelf and i would recommend this book to anyone truly if gi ##bra ##n was a religion the prophet would be my bible never has inspiration hit me with such velocity as reading this book i first became aware of ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n when i read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite lebanese restaurant ever since then i have sought out his books the prophet is my favorite several of the poems or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life the book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others there is barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on ##lov ##e marriage death and all of our own ins ##ec ##urities and doubts about people and life this would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough time or just has una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions at a certain point in their lives the writing is luc ##id insight ##ful and will be relevant for as long as time goes on the drawings add to an already great work at my favorite lebanese restaurant i not only found good food ##i thankfully found ka ##hli ##l gi ##bra ##n this is gi

classic in its own right sure to help a whole new generation of readers discover this exceptional author the concept of writing two storylines in two sep ##erate time periods with each effortlessly

final page and iv ##e re ##rea ##d it several times i bought this one for a family member in hopes she enjoys it as much as i have she loved the out ##lander series and i told her this is a precursor similar in some plot points and just as exciting if not more ##so kingdom of shadows by ms erskine is also a keeper a talented author and highly recommended its an interesting premise but im halfway through and finding the main characters annoying its dated both in technology and the behavior of the main characters can ##t help feeling that this author almost gets there this was a great read once you started you did not want to put it down if anyone has wondered what a short trip to the past would be like this is a perfect book for you it leaves you wondering i what if im an avid history lover and the history kept me interested ##w ##hat didn ##t work for me was the present day storyline ##and why would the main character continue to stay around with the abuse ##rs i won ##t give spoil ##ers but it was annoying ##i was glad when the weak conclusion resulted ##if not for the history lesson i would have stopped reading it i loved everything about this book i had a really hard time putting it down i highly recommend reading it although i really enjoyed the premise of this book the modern ##day story didn ##t capt ##ivate me nearly as much as the th century portion matilda was strong resource ##ful independent and brave and the men in her life were interesting if not necessarily like ##able jo on the other hand seemed to be a mas ##och ##ist who surrounded herself with men who mist ##reate ##d her and betrayed her trust she continued to rely on them and trust them long after they ##d proven themselves un ##worthy the ending although not unexpected just didn ##t ring true especially in the case of one major character who seemed to go through such an unbelievable transformation throughout the book as to almost be ba ##ff ##ling this story with all its power emotion and history com ##pel ##s me to read it over and over matilda de bra ##ose was a real person in history and her story helped cause the magna cart ##a to be forced upon king john at run ##ny ##med ##e i love english history and this book though romantic ##ized is full of it reading this book is a great way to spend ones time i can ##t recommend it too strongly i love this story of remembering a pat lifetime its got everything one of the best books i have read ms erskine tends to be a bit word ##y but her tales are wonderful this is a terrific story very good story full of history ##my kind of book this book was fast paced and thought pro ##voking the characters carried me through the story but at times i had to put the book down to think about what had happened could this really happen could one bounce from one time to another how interesting and fun that would be entertaining but i found it de ##pressing it was well written but i found for me not enough variation it was too much of the same thing the story line was fairly imp ##laus ##ible and the modern day characters were hard to relate to but i really enjoyed this novel anyway i bought the book because matilda de bra ##ose is one of my ancestors and i was interested to read about what her life may have been like i really liked the different take on the historical novel weaving a modern day suspense novel with historical fiction the modern day heroine jo clifford could be quite ex ##as ##per ##ating and it was hard to understand why she continued her relationships with the men in her life who all mist ##reate ##d her but the suspense aspect of the modern day story mixed with the un ##folding of the historical story really kept me turning the pages i recommend this for historical fiction fans looking for something a bit different compelling from start to finish difficult to put down a gripping story with characters you ##ll want to visit again i love this book iv ##e been reading it every couple of years since in fact i read it until the pages fell out of my paperback i have a kind ##le edition now publishers weekly says what slow ##s the narrative is the be ##vy of minor characters jo ##s acquaintances they talk to her and about her they try to help her and they con ##sp ##ire against her all at the expense of the central plot ##line i think the minor characters serve to make this a rich story with more depth than you often find they form the world around the main characters i fall in love with tim every time i also enjoy the trips jo and matilda take with the very different points of view they lend to the descriptions overall this novel has a bit of everything in a well ##pace ##d story i didn ##t have particularly high expectations for this book and have been very disappointed by many kind ##le books however this book not only got me through a very long transatlantic plane ride but kept me en ##th ##ral ##led until the last page which i read at home the historical detail was wonderful and seemed accurate the contemporary characters were interesting although some seemed more realistic than others the regression ##s were fascinating and it was a pain ##less way to absorb some history i have recommended the book to friends and intend to read more by the author the book was written in the s and it is interesting reading about the contemporary characters using type ##writer ##s and not having cell phones also today the characters would have instant access to most of the historical information they needed this does not det ##rac ##t from the book but it took me back not the full years it took me a little bit to actually get into the book i started it at least three times until i forced myself to keep going once i started to actually read on a regular basis i was hooked i would stay up late because i had to know what was going to happen the relationship between the two main characters was a little unbelievable but its fiction so that didn ##t stop me i thought the story was very well put together and the history involved was interesting if you like historical romance with a little mystery then this book is for you ri ##vi ##ting read could not put it down as

##le edition erskine barbara lady of hay two women eight hundred years and the destiny they share p source ##books kind ##le edition the author used quite a complex medium of narration i must say to

this novel even if you don ##t really care nor is invested into rein ##car ##nation as me the splendid work done by the author on the historical part is outstanding the novel is therefore multi ##layer ##ed and complex i definitely will be reading more novels from this author spoil ##ers alert my complaints i felt the end was rushed the author never really explained how sam knew all along who he was in jo ##s past life i quite did not agree that nick represented king john in my opinion richard de clare was a better choice you will learn that her love affair with this last one was fictitious anyway i loved the descriptions of the characters and their surroundings it felt like i was right there with them i loved following jo ##s story i was really root ##ing for her this book was ok ##it just seemed to keep going and going and going it was hard to finish this book i absolutely loved this novel the time travel thru h ##yp ##nosis concept was great i didn ##t put this book down until i had finished and wished there was more barbara erskine is a terrific author one of my all time favorites this is one of those books that you either embrace whole ##hearted ##ly or dislike intensely i think i read this many years ago and found myself quite di ##sat ##is ##fied with how the story unfolded however this is my second reading of jo clifford ##mat ##il ##da de bro ##ase the lady of hay and i really enjoyed it the second time around matilda was a woman of her time with very few options open to her but how she def ##ied a prince gave all for her family and was betrayed by her husband is compelling reading that is where the strength of the story lies the medieval aspect the political int ##rigue and the love ##hat ##e relationship between prince john and matilda but this book did have its det ##raction ##s i would have liked more explanation for williams course of action there were major rep ##er ##cus ##sions for matilda and her family the characters depicted in the present weren ##t as strongly depicted as their alter ego ##s and it was difficult to feel any empathy or sympathy towards them still i very much enjoyed the medieval setting and the story of matilda de bra ##ose this is one of my favorite books i love the history of england and can find a number of the characters in my family tree i think this book is similar to the time ##tra ##vel ##lers wife as it jumps back and forward not a real favourite of that type storyline barbara erskine ##s novel lady of hay in part an historical novel about maud or matilda de bra ##ose who had the mis ##fort ##une of living during the time of king john the bad is one of those novels with parallel plot ##lines in s england we meet year ##old jo clifford who has an amazing ability as a subject in a regression h ##yp ##nosis when she re ##li ##ves the last tortured moments of a th ##cent ##ury norman ##fr ##en ##ch woman whose husband held a great deal of power in the welsh marches during the reign of henry ii and his sons richard the lion ##heart and king john the modern story then jumps years and we meet year ##old jo clifford successful journalist and as hard ##head ##ed as you expect a modern woman to be she is given an assignment to investigate regression h ##yp ##nosis which is a technique that claims to access a persons memory of a past life jo initially po ##oh ##poo ##hs the idea until she becomes a subject herself at that point the medieval story takes off i am not alone in finding the medieval story more compelling primarily because the stakes are so high giving ms erskine opportunities for building a spine of tension to hold up the story arc the modern part of the story was not interesting the relationship between jo clifford and her on ##aga ##in off ##aga ##in boyfriend nick went round and around and around and while true to life this spinning of wheels meant that many opportunities for tension were lost nick ##s brother sam is cast as the mad scientist and as a former scientist myself i wish that ms erskine had es ##che ##wed the cl ##iche ##s and dug deeper to have formed a more interesting character sam ##s motivation is not clear except that he seems to have gone quite mad for no apparent reason my question was how did we get from the concerned young man we glimpse ##d in to the out ##of ##con ##tro ##l sad ##ist in no satisfactory answer is given the modern story deserves stars the medieval story deserves stars so i am giving this novel stars for years lady of hay has been my favorite book it is capt ##ivating takes the reader from the present to the th century i can imagine myself having lived a previous life because the author barbara erskine ##pres ##ents the image so well i can visual ##ize it like i was actually living it even though it is a huge book i have read it twice and will likely read it at least once more barbara erskine ken f ##oll ##ett and diana ga ##bal ##don capture the spirit of the past and transport the reader back as if they actually lived the life ku ##dos to them beautifully written and could not put it down ##l loved the present to the past concept and the suspense i will definitely read more from this author not wanting to spoil the plot i will not explain but it has sparked an interest in past life regression it is well worth reading i have mixed feelings about this book its a modern day woman who has visions and goes off in search of herself her visions are of another woman who lived hundreds of years previously and the two stories are inter ##twined as she has these visions and questions her sanity and as she discovers the story of the woman from a previous era i liked the story generally speaking it was well thought out and fairly well portrayed but honestly i would rather have just had the story about the woman in the past i found the modern day parts to be frankly boring and the whole voyage of self ##dis ##co ##very via hall ##uc ##inations thing didn ##t really do it for me this was a rep ##ur ##chase and re ##rea ##dt ##he original literally fell apart ##rea ##d it many hears ago and just wanted to read it again ##if you like history and nov ##es ##l based partly on truth ##thi ##s would be a book for youth ##e historical facts are correct i love to read and read a book a week the story idea was interesting but i didn ##t like the characters and it just fi ##zzled out joe ##dan ##don ##ig ##i i got the kind ##le version of this book and cover is different so don ##t be surprised if kind ##le editions looks different from this a cave ##at now on to the book the main protagonist jo lives in the current time as jo and in the past as welsh lady named matilda she jumps in the past and the future pretty seam ##lessly and the author barbara erskine seems to be adept at carrying on two love triangles or squares would be more precise but not as phonetic ##ally pleasing though iv ##e never been to wales the writing is good enough to ev ##oke me effortlessly to believe i have been there even though i haven ##t i can imagine it just as i can imagine living years ago in wales this surprised me couple of times and that ##s what i like i want to try to guess before the author makes it obvious this kept me on my figurative toes photo ##man ##mm i confess that i have a love of books that explore past lives of the characters im not sure i believe in rein ##car ##nation but i wo ##uo ##ld like to in the lady of hay the possible past life ##po ##ssi ##ble posse ##sion of journalist jo clifford as the lady of hay is explored jo begins her exploration of past life regression as research for an article she plans on writing soon she is totally immersed in her past life being drawn back to her past at inc ##on ##ven ##ient times in inc ##on ##ven ##ient ways a sm ##atter ##ing of darkness evil and insanity invade ##s both ##of her lives as she struggles to make sense of what is real and what isn ##t i have to say that while i loved the story and the authors style i really did not like jo she struck me as wi ##mp ##y and weak in both lives that said my feelings for the main character did not take away my total enjoyment of the book definitely recommended reading i read this book years ago and i loved it i thought that the lives and story lines that were inter ##wo ##ven were really interesting i have often felt the pull to the past myself and when i read this book i started to think the author may have not just created an imagined story i really got involved in the twists and turns of the plot again i loved it can ##t wait to read it again i had a hard time getting into the story in the beginning but once i started to be more familiar with names and places i couldn ##t put the book down i was so caught up in the story now that i have finished the book i find myself with many many una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions and loose ends i really enjoyed this book however it is a very long book it is well written with a capt ##ivating story based on real people jo a journalist involved with nick her lover is h ##yp ##not ##ised and reg ##resses years into the english and welsh past she is then matilda who lived in the time of henry the n ##d of england she is married to william debra ##ose a cruel lord but is in love with richard declare another noble she travels back and forth through time eventually recognizing her modern companions from her life in the past sometimes she travels through h ##yp ##nosis sometimes she reg ##resses spontaneously the book takes you through some actual events some imagined but it keeps you interested i was compelled to look up the characters online and found them very interesting also i do think barbara erskine could have condensed the book when she wrote it in her research is very good but like some other authors she tends to dig ##ress book was enjoyable people who are into paranormal incarnation new age would most likely enjoy this book i have not read other books by this author but would consider doing so this is a rather con ##vo ##lu ##ted story given that you must keep track of both past and present story lines for multiple characters the characters are compelling by themselves but when placed into this particular story they become en ##tra ##nc ##ing ms erskine was very thorough in researching the material for this book and the descriptive details were wonderful ##ly en ##chan ##ting the only place i feel she slipped a bit was in the way the historical characters spoke occasionally using the word hey which was not introduced into common language until several hundred years after the historical portion of the story took place and for all that lady de bao ##rse was a trail ##bla ##zer i still found it a bit challenging to reconcile her attitude and how on the one hand she spoke to men particularly the king as if they were equals and on the other hand she would talk about the duties of women being to submit to their husbands and acknowledging that they were owned by their husbands just like a horse or an item of clothing but much of that can be forgiven and understood since the lady de bao ##rse was being channel ##ed by a modern ##day woman who wouldn ##t be afraid of men as women of the s would be since women were chat ##tel and only used to gain necessary alliances and such that hi ##cc ##up aside the story is ri ##vet ##ing all the main characters are strong forces on their own and combined together they become a volatile mix even the secondary characters have a surprising depth not often seen in a character that may only be in two or three scenes in the entire book just when you feel that the story arc is beginning to drag you are w ##his ##ked back in time to re ##li ##ve the extraordinary life of matilda otherwise known as the lady de bao ##rse however for the majority of the book the story moves right along at a lovely clip if you have an issue with want ##on alcohol consumption be fore ##war ##ned as im not sure if there is a single scene in which either alcohol or coffee is not consumed and often the coffee contains alcohol also jo comes across as having a rather loose moral code when it comes to sex but i much of that is driven by the historical portions of the book oddly enough this book is perfect for those who enjoyed such books as the other bo ##ley ##n girl the virgin ##s lover and other books that take historical periods and their more well ##k ##now ##n people and try to rec ##reate what their lives might have been like while that may sound like a simple romance novel it is clear the hundreds of hours of research that goes into the creation of the tops ##hel ##f books of this genre and there is no doubt in my mind that this book belongs up near the tops ##hel ##f with the others though it is not in the same league as the diana ga ##bal ##don ##s out ##lander series definitely a challenge to put the book down and get anything else done until i finished reading it thankfully it is a fairly quick read regardless of its size i enjoyed the history and ps ##cho ##logical turns in this book it was very suspense ##ful up to the last and easy to read it was pretty good but the story was too drawn out much repetition of the same theme the story itself was ok well ##written and enjoyable lady of hay is a book ill re ##rea ##d and recommend to my reading book club its difficult to find such a good book these days love stories that go back in time author does a great job of blending the past with the present stories i couldn ##t put it down im not usually a fan of this particular genre but i literally could not put it down when my kind ##le ran low on power i plug ##ged it up and kept on reading this book held my interest for the most part but the author ruined the story for me by having the past become a physical part of the subjects past life except for that i did enjoy the book this book kept me up late at night the story un ##fold ##s at a great pace inter ##ming ##ling present and past i was so involved in lady matilda ##s and jo ##s characters and their inter ##twined des ##tin ##ies that i could literally feel their emotions pain and fear the book is so well written it plunge ##s you right in the middle of it all a great story i would highly recommend it this book will make you want to discuss with others who have read it it stays with you long after you have finished it barbara erskine tells an intriguing tale of life with kings and nobles i especially like the way she tied it to the present wow this book is so great it was hard to put down the history and current time stories were both fascinating a must read i enjoy fictional novels of centuries past and have some training in h ##yp ##nosis so at the beginning of the book i was intrigued with joanne main character who finds herself fi ##pping back and forth from th century to present the story began to un ##rave ##l for me as more and more people in joanna ##s life became also a part of her past life and somehow all seemed to get reg ##ressed to the same time slot at times there was more than a credibility gap and even though i enjoyed the theme of the story i found the ending to be very weak the content of this story left no impression in my memory all i can remember is that i did not enjoy it and cannot recall even the theme let alone the detail six weeks after reading it if you are into historical fiction this book will not di ##sa ##pp ##oint engaging and entertaining for a quiet rainy day read i enjoy stories about past lives i love good historical novels i have some first hand experience with hypnotic regression i usually love novels written years ago but not this one it managed to ann ##oy me on many levels one could excuse the repeated violent rape scenes including one per ##pet ##rated by the hero as being characteristic of the s when this book was written as that was a time before women had finally figured out that a man who says i love you and then per ##pet ##rates a violent rape belongs in prison not in your bed one might even excuse as characteristic of the s is the fact that all the protagonists in the story behave like alcoholic ##s downing what we now would consider volumes of drink that would be diagnosed as bing ##e drinking in just about every scene set in the present but one one cannot excuse the ridiculous way in which h ##yp ##nosis and past life regression are presented in this story and the silly way that everyone including supposed medical professionals encourage what would be in real life a psychotic reaction in the heroine the heroine herself is too stupid to live ##the classic dumb heroine who when warned not to go down into the darkened basement while a killer is on the loose and the power is out always goes into the basement if you enjoy that kind of story you ##ll love this one if you like your heroine to be slightly brighter than a guinea pig save your cents and download something else the worst part of this book is that the writer has enough of a command of style to get you reading this b ##lo ##ated endless ##ly long book so that it isn ##t until you ##ve gotten more than half way through that you realize just how stupid the plotting is if you keep reading after that you are rewarded with a completely unbelievable and emotionally un ##sat ##is ##fied ending further complaints the book claims that the history that lies behind the endless ##ly dull past ##life story is well ##res ##ear ##ched but any author who puts bu ##bon ##ic plague into a story set in the last decades of the s has not done their research even in the days before google mildly educated people knew that the plague first appeared in europe in if the book had swept me into an emotionally moving story i would have easily overlooked the inn ##ac ##cu ##rac ##ies but the emotional interaction between the main characters is wooden and we never get into their heads or feel their reactions both in the story set in the present and the one in the past both are static with no character undergoing a hint of growth anywhere the characters are the same on at the end which felt like page by the time i got there as they were in chapter how this book got to be a bestseller in a world that produced out ##lander a few years later is beyond me perhaps you had to read it in to love it since there do seem to be many readers who did but reading it in i certainly didn ##t between the rape scenes and the endless boring interactions between dull english people living what must have been considered a g ##lam ##orous life in the mid ##s this book struck me as one that should have remained a fond memory although i don ##t believe in rein ##car ##nation i do wonder about imprint ##ed genetic memories this story starts kind of slow i didn ##t really get into the story until after page im glad i stuck with it because it really is a good story the author makes the transitions from present day to early wales in an easy way some of the descriptions were a bit long and the book could have been edited to a slightly shorter version with all that i still recommend it as a good read if you like rein ##car ##nation and flash backs certainly a twist as to the who done it portion i had looked forward to reading this book after listening to the audio book version of daughters if fire which i found fascinating this was unfortunate because by comparison lady of hay felt repetitive albeit written many years before and therefore if read in chronological order maybe daughters of fire would have been slightly less en ##th ##ral ##ling i was impressed by the depth of historical research in the books the attention to detail and insight into the characters both ancient and modern i felt i was observing joy and despair feast ##s in the great hall and the loneliness of cold dark castles the change of seasons and fortunes lady of hay is a good holiday read for those who enjoy big fat novels and have a kind ##le read this years ago but lost my copy a good historical romance lots of detail and good characters does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint this book could be about half its published length it goes on and on and on ##per ##ha ##ps so the author can insert yet another rape scene the writing itself isn ##t awful but the characters constant f ##ow ##l language and the rape authors ins ##ati ##able longing to write yet another rape scene ruin it i loved this book i had a very strong emotional response to it don ##t let the title fool you barbara erskine made this one soo ##o bel ##ie ##vable for me that i google ##d some of the names of the characters and places some of them really did exist they way its woven together is amazing i couldn ##t put it dow ##m when at work i kept thinking about it and couldn ##t wait to get home to read i found the concept of past life regression interesting in this book it was enjoyable to read it did drag on in a few spots the good i loved the premise of remembering of past lives and the inter ##t ##win ##ing with the present the historical elements were well done and the scenery was vivid the idea that there are these three men who were in love with matilda who are still in love with her present incarnation of jo is handled fairly well there is an interesting unexpected twist in the romance and your ##e not entirely sure who is going to win out in the end or why the not ##so ##good the characters were too inconsistent and un ##real ##istic if the characters are actually the same people from the past why did they change so much as soon as they began to remember also the present dilemma was nothing more than dealing with the stress of remembering the past it would have been nice to see a parallel story in the present aside from the romance that had more to do with modern reality but somehow reflected the past i agree with other reviewers that this was wa ##aa ##aa ##y too long and jo ##s reaction to the abuse is weird i couldn ##t put this down and have rec ##com ##ended it to several friends i think its well written and extremely entertaining i was drawn into the h ##yp ##nosis scenes and fa ##cina ##ted how all the counterparts came together in the present day define ##tly a good read i read this a few years ago and loved it then it was great having a modern part added after years i couldn ##t put the book down again and enjoyed it even more the second time around barbara erskine is an excellent writer and i have read all her books i enjoyed this book its themes of fictional ##ised but fact ##base ##d english history and of past ##life recall are both en ##tic ##ing to me and what others say about the authors ability to ev ##oke the sensory experience of time and place is true its all quite vivid but i did not find the characters well ##dra ##wn and i agree with the reviewer who pointed out the multiple rape ##s etc after which the main character seems to go back for more that was annoying ##ly off ##put ##ting i have the impression that the author did a fair amount of research but sometimes i doubted the accuracy of historical details i don ##t like that feeling and i don ##t want to go look everything up another thing i found annoying was the vocabulary in the kind ##le edition i read the author and the heroine and the setting are english ##we ##ls ##h so why the references to sidewalks gasoline and taking the subway was this some sort of mis ##con ##ce ##ive ##d editorial policy for american readers a light and pleasant read and its several final chapters got me through a very long plane journey i was sure i would love this book after reading the other reviews and the fact that i love historical english fiction but this book is truly awful the premise is wonderful and the book starts off great but it soon becomes repetitive and di ##s ##jo ##int ##ed also i volunteer for a domestic abuse support center and the scenes of a young woman allowing herself to be physically abused over and over were very disturbing i wish the book had lived up to my expectations i read this book years ago must have been not long after it first came out i remembered really liking it and looked forward to re ##rea ##ding it what a difference on the second reading the male ##fe ##mal ##e relationships are so dated the violence and abuse against jo are horrible and her taking it and going back to her rap ##ist over and over are app ##all ##ing the character ##iza ##ton ##s are two dimensional and the writing is mel ##od ##rama ##tic and ridiculous im quite frankly ashamed of my younger self for liking it so much there are much better past life novels out there the winter sea by susanna ke ##ars ##ley is one that i recently read and thought quite good i would stay away from this one lady of hay was my first barbara e novel and as a consequence i have a soft spot for it and have to admit to having read it several times it is not a novel that requires a great deal of thinking on the part of the reader but that takes nothing away from the story itself which i enjoyed the characters did not grab me in the way that i like writers such as elizabeth chad ##wick the champion or or catherine a and catherine t wilson the lily and the lion do it better but i liked it none the less for an international flight or a long car trip the book description and plot appealed to me as i am interested in both rein ##car ##nation and historical fiction i started reading the book and found it interesting but the further i got the less engaging it seemed about a third of the way through i realized that i was starting to ski ##m read about half way through i started skipping entire chapters in the end i never finished the book or even read the end it had potential but i have read this book a number of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it again i love barbara ##s style of writing and the history in her stories this book had everything history romance thriller the characters were great it was very exciting the book was hard to put down one of my favourite books and so glad to have it on my kind ##le great interesting del ##ves into a time of history that is fascinating and written in such an easy to read enjoyable un ##put ##down ##able way can thoroughly recommend this book and any of barbara erskine ##s books fantastic read there ##s no reason to give a syn ##opsis of lady of hay others have done that so ill just tell why i liked it first i liked the movement between past and present it occurred smoothly and it gave me my medieval fix as well as a foot in the here and now next i liked the various explanations of the phenomenon that jo and the others were experiencing dr bennett ##s annie ##s ce ##ec ##li ##ffs etc i also liked how the characters were drawn jo nick tim sam as well as their medieval counterparts finally i liked the theme of rein ##car ##nation i highly recommend this book incident ##ally i have a recommendation for anyone who likes novels with a rein ##car ##nation theme green darkness by anya seton barbara erskine has a phd in scottish history you can look up all the historical details that she weave ##s into her stories and find them as being true if you don ##t like the genre of books a bit of fantasy is mixed with proven historical facts then this book is not for you if you like to learn about history by ways of a fantasy novel you can ##t find anything better one of my favorite books and by the way i read all of barbara erskine ##s books i didn ##t hate it but i am not sure it was worth reading the past lives overs ##tory was fine until it went totally ho ##key the rape scene ill pretty much read anything but this book goes on a very short list of books so awful i couldn ##t finish the story is an interesting idea but the characters are un ##real ##istic and the plot chaotic to compare this to diana ga ##bal ##don is unfair to diana ever since i first heard of the un ##thi ##nka ##ble ##hor ##ri ##fi ##c death of matilda de bra ##ose and her oldest son iv ##e felt a sympathetic fascination towards her so when i remembered i had this book in my possession i was eager to read it mrs erskine does a brilliant job at bringing a woman and her family who have been dead for over years to life as well as painting a vivid portrait of not only the world they lived in but the daily realities of that world the story is eng ##ross ##ing and well researched as far as i can tell although my knowledge of english history is still very ru ##diment ##ary however the book is also entirely too long it took me about days to read it and at times the narrative dragged and became very repetitive and i found myself wishing that i could just get to the end as tragic and gripping as matilda and her sons death scene and other passages was i sighed in relief when i came to the last page i feel the story would have been better told if the book was about pages shorter as a last positive note ##im very glad that this book was written because i feel that it expose ##s matilda and her story ##hor ##ri ##fi ##c fate to a large and continuing audience that would likely never hear of her otherwise lord knows that a woman and her son being thrown into a dungeon and starved to death on the direct and deliberate orders of a monstrous ##ly cruel king should never be forgotten the suffering of both both physically and mentally before death finally came must have been unbelievable ps to any history buff ##s while this book is based on real people and events and is basically accurate one should be aware that there are events that by the authors own admission never occurred such as matilda ##s great love affair with a handsome ##das ##hing nobleman ##w ##ho also really existed others are the pure speculation such as matilda ##s rape by the same king that would later order her death king john if using such devices to spice up a story and speculation about real people and events ir ##ks you then you should definitely stay clear i read constantly and i agree with other reviewers about the excessive and unnecessary violence in this book there are less than books in my entire life i did not finish but i finally threw this book out it was not fair to in ##flict it on my local library the time period is definitely violent but it seemed that whenever the author did not know what to do she threw in a rape scene i will never purchase another book by this author when i downloaded this book i was expecting something like a traditional time travel romance you know the modern heroine goes back in time and discovers her true love this book is nothing like that and the unexpected unpredictable nature of the plot was a pleasant surprise that said this isn ##t a very easy book to read matilda is treated like a means to an end during many parts of her life and virtually all the men in her life either let her down or subject her to violence since we to some extent expect that from the distant past those parts are easier to read than the parts where joanna the woman in who is experiencing matilda ##s life goes through the exact same treatment from the men that she knows what she experiences is bad what is even worse is the casual attitude that everybody has about it what happened to your face did he hit you too bad the book is fascinating and the author does a good job of setting up the parallel stories as well as how joanna is compelled to go forward even when she knows it is dangerous for her to continue reg ##ress ##ing it is a little odd how everybody is so connected oh let me tell you about this person you can go visit who will know stuff to help you but that is overlook ##able the book does drag at parts though it is difficult to determine what could have been cut out what you get in this book is a very enjoyable and well ##don ##e story that will take you at least a few days to read parts of it are very graphic when it comes to violence against women specifically intimate partner violence but that is part of life and i don ##t fault the author for covering it in her book jo an investigative journalist is working on a series about h ##yp ##nosis past ##life regression and rein ##car ##nation initially skeptical she allows herself to become h ##yp ##not ##ized as part of her research immediately she begins re ##li ##ving the life of matilda the scottish lady of hay who lived eighth ##und ##red years earlier as she becomes more and more involved in matilda ##s life the men around her also appear to be rein ##car ##nation ##s of the men in matilda ##s life i was immediately drawn into the story through erskine ##s writing style and dynamic characters the historical nature of the book was carefully en ##twined with the present creating an interesting and dynamic plot at times the book did seem to drag on and the people jo encountered seemed a bit too ser ##end ##ip ##ito ##us despite these flaws i highly enjoyed this book this book was so hard to take breaks from reading and now that i am done i wish it was longer really well written i love a story where i can not guess the end just a few chapters in i was going to write up a nice review of this book and i see that someone named western reader has pretty much jo ##tted down my thoughts perfectly i really liked this book however there were parts that moved a little slow i loved going back and forth between centuries and the constant who is the good character and who is the bad if it moved just a little faster i would have given it a star review but i gave it i would recommend that you read it perhaps you would have a different perspective i loved this book its not perfect but its well worth my time and money there were parts that dragged on but i couldn ##t put the book down read this book if you like historical novels it is worth your time lady of hay is one of the most interesting books iv ##e read this year the attention to detail of events from the th and th centuries counter ##posed against modern times grabbed my attention right from the start the thought of being able to travel to the past has always intrigued me and this book didn ##t di ##sa ##pp ##oint it is well plotted and the characters are well developed while those characters are certainly all too human sam is probably one of the s ##nar ##kie ##st vi ##lli ##ans iv ##e read about in recent months of course there ##s the argument was it all planned by sam in his evil twisted mind or was he really william was nick really king john or did sam really do a number on nick via hypnotic suggestion was jo just an impression ##able woman hoisted on her own pet ##ard of vivid imagination and a love of history or was she really a rein ##car ##nation of matilda each reader must make his ##her own decision me i just went along for the ride and enjoyed every moment along the way i learned a bit more about english history and that ##s a good thing too i highly recommend this book for a jolly good read i though i would never get to the end of this book i felt like i was nearing the end and i was only a third of the way through there were way too many characters that were completely unnecessary way to much talking and back and forth about the same things over and over and over get h ##yp ##not ##ized no its dangerous no i have to stay with me go away blah blah blah all these people did was go back and forth between each others houses argue and drive to old castles after the first third of the book i skimmed and skipped so much but didn ##t really miss any ##thi ##gn i enjoyed the past life part at first but then even that got a bit de ##pressing nothing good happens in this book oh except for epilogue which seemed tack ##ed on at the last minute and doesn ##t really fit the rest of the book the only reason i gave it stars instead of was because i did actually want to find out how the story ended so apparently there was something in it that pulled me in in spite of myself but im certainly not keeping this one around when i first saw the description of the book i was not convinced it was something i wanted to read it took me days to decide and i am glad i took the chance the book takes you back into the time of kings barons and earls but at the same time makes you grip on to the modern world the author does not waste the readers time by using run on sentences or place unnecessary information into the book the writer takes you on a roller coaster ride of em ##mot ##ions from the view of three main ch ##rac ##ters but also introducing the roles of other persons in the book to help bring about the story you know it is a good book when you want to start and figure out for your self what is happen ##ein ##g and you know it is awesome when even in your dreams you want to know what the end results going to be i was really happy i got this book even though i usually stick to para ##no ##uma ##l book high praises to the writer fantastic ##ally written i recommended it to all my friends this is one of my favorite books i bought it on a ferry between victoria and seattle i loved it so much that i bought as many of her books as i could find so neat that she has been revived great writer great plot the premise of the book is regression of past lives that affect present lives other historical fiction authors portray maud de bra ##ose as an mean spirited sh ##rew this version clean ##s her up and makes her much more sympathetic i don ##t think that is historically valid but these problems really didn ##t imp ##air my ability to totally enjoy the book i read this book based on the recommendation by a friend and was surprised by how much i loved it for some reason the back cover summary left me skeptical and un ##con ##vin ##ced i finished the book tonight and loved it the mix of a modern day story versus the period time story of the past life kept me interested and turning the pages or pushing my kind ##le button forward is more like it i think people who are fans of the out ##lander series by diana ga ##bal ##don will relate well to and enjoy this book as well don ##t let the past life part scare you off highly recommend it i think this was a great book it is almost like getting two books for the price of one the current day cast has a past that ties them together years ago it was very well written and slid from present to past and back smoothly i think the whole story was good i read it day after day and carried my kind ##le around with me like i used to carry a book to the table at dinner when i was a kid if you enjoy stories of the past and a good love story then this is a good choice i read a lot of english historical fiction i was really surprised to see all the good reviews for this book i thought much of it was boring hard to read very con ##tri ##ved and un ##real ##istic also there is a disturbing amount of abuse of the heroine including multiple rape ##s and the heroine keeps going back for more sp ##iol ##ers alert at least four characters sam ##wil ##lia ##m and nick ##jo ##hn ##are violently abusive to the main character the only interesting thing about it for me was the look at the life of mo ##ll wall ##be i could barely get through this book and was glad when it was over this was a well thought out detailed story with so many twists and turns it gave the plot a new dimension there was a definite line between past and present for the reader but confusion for the characters themselves i began reading this book expecting one thing and it surprised me with something else all the characters were well defined and completely bel ##ie ##vable i actually found myself with tears in my eyes a few times the historical aspect was well written and as the plot became more intense i was root ##ing for multiple characters this book kept me up reading late at night theresa b though i am not one that really believes in past lives i am aware that those types of things make for a good story its also a good way for a story to use both history and present day to inter ##t ##wine a great story about a historic figure lady of hay is a dramatic story of joanna who is researching hypnotic regression which i am not sure i believe in either and as she researches this she decided to let them put her under h ##yp ##nosis while under h ##yp ##nosis jo becomes matilda matilda is a young lady from the th century and her life a mixture of emotions matilda ##s husband william is not really nice king john feels he can do what he wants with her and richard de clare is the only man who really loves and understand her joanna has a life not to far away from matilda ##s as she has a group of men who think they know what is best for her but she is not married to any of them and jo is pretty head strong but with each man thinking they know what ##s best for her she finds her self confused and overwhelmed and sometimes she has a hard time distinguishing between herself and matilda at times it was a interesting story about two different centuries but two women who where a lot alike although i don ##t really believe in rein ##car ##nation past life stuff it was still a interesting story and if you like historical ##mo ##dern storytelling then i think you would like this book lady of hay was an interesting dive into the world of h ##yp ##nosis and some would say time travel the story uses the theory of hypnotic regression as well as the concept of rein ##car ##nation to support the plot i myself am not a believer in either of these psychological ##sp ##iri ##tua ##l ideas so my approach to this novel was that of a time ##tra ##vel fan i saw our main characters not as rein ##car ##nated but as people whose minds seemed to be alternating from to the turn of the th century im sure this wasn ##t the authors intent but it enabled me to enjoy the story joanna is a fei ##sty young writer researching the topic of hypnotic regression for an article that she ##s putting together for an english publication through her research she finds that she seems to be in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##bly tied to matilda de st valerie born in ad and wed to william de bra ##ose in other friends and associates in her life also seem to be linked to citizens of ancient england through h ##yp ##nosis the past and the present begin to inter ##ming ##le leading to life ##ord ##ea ##th situations for some of the main characters originally released in lady of hay went on to sell over million copies this is not surprising to me as erskine weave ##s an interesting and compelling tale i enjoyed the frequent alter ##nation ##s between past and present as well as the various struggles that characters went through in the different time periods there was suspense romance mystery and a dynamic plot that pressed on with consistent energy until the conclusion as a non ##bel ##ie ##ver of rein ##car ##nation i wish the story could have been told in another way i think one motivation of using rein ##car ##nation is to give characters a chance to begin again and try to improve upon what has happened in a past life even attempt to at ##one for mistakes they ##ve made especially with loved ones this is a central and driving need for all of us ##the desire to be loved and to achieve a state of reconciliation or at ##one ##ment as such the reader can relate to the desires felt by the modern characters of jo sam nick and tim despite all the hardship ##s they endured and ##or per ##pet ##rated in their souls they sought love and resolution because of my religious faith and some of the graphic and adult nature of some of this novel i can ##t say that i would heart ##ily recommend it to those who share my beliefs however if you can look past the spiritual over ##tones and see it as a time ##tra ##vel ##ing adventure and a realistic depiction of how people lived were treated years ago then you should enjoy lady of hay not all of it wraps up with a perfectly tied bow at the end but the main conclusion is satisfying and the tale as a whole was an interesting experience if nothing else it made me grateful for the beliefs i hold to be true and not fiction and for the husband i heart ##ily enjoy in this singular life i wish i could give this title stars as i enjoyed it but not enough to warrant stars journalist joanna clifford is researching regression by h ##yp ##nosis for an article she is writing in jo herself was h ##yp ##not ##ized but remembers very little about the incident what she doesn ##t know is that she nearly died during the session her heart having stopped and the h ##yp ##not ##her ##ap ##ist gave her a mental suggestion so that she would not remember anything that occurred now years later jo has agreed to be h ##yp ##not ##ized again for her research her old flame nick is adamant ##ly trying to talk her out of it while his brother sam is as well however after the first session jo reg ##resses to years in the past and finds herself seeing her life through the eyes of matilda de bra ##ose the lady of hay before she knows it jo ##s hypnotic trance ##s are getting really vivid and she is having a hard time distinguishing what ##s real from what happened to matilda she learns that matilda was un ##ha ##pp ##ily married to william but was secretly in love with richard de clare she

experiences matilda giving birth to her first born son when jo awake ##ns she find herself having post ##par ##tum symptoms she also misses the baby and hears him crying at night jo starts to think that she may have at one point in time actually been the lady of hay and is just now remembering her past life she also insists on being h ##yp ##not ##ized again and again until she finds out what became of matilda but soon enough scared of what is happening to her she tries to make herself forget matilda to no avail at pages lady of hay is a pretty he ##ft ##y book it took me about pages in to get hooked on the story all the while i didn ##t really relate to any of the characters but i was curious about what was going to happen next the plot fascinated me but some of the characters annoyed me mostly the men in jo ##s life there ##s some physical violence during the current day storyline and the female characters put up with it which had me shaking my head as i read i found the scenes where jo would reg ##ress into matilda ##s life to be really interesting that ##s when the book really took a turn into the historical fiction element of the story barbara erskine makes a smooth transition from jo ##s world to matilda ##s and vice versa you can also tell that the author did al ##ot of research for the book the events and people in matilda ##s world are well detailed the plot is full of drama backs ##ta ##bbing time travel and a touch of romance i liked the paranormal element to the book as well there ##s al ##ot going on in this story and i found myself hooked from the second half of the book until the end this is a wonderful story but very heavy the emotions of the characters reel you in as if you were a prize catch on the line but believe me when i say that there is no struggling to put this down i found this real and eng ##ross ##ing as if you are watching a d movie in the best of theaters our heroine jo volunteers for an experiment on h ##yp ##not ##ism right from the start our secondary characters are in awe and pretty much scared half out of their wits with the intensity of jo ##s regression the results bring forth many physical manifestation ##s that could bring about a costly price to jo herself so her memory is wiped clean for her own safety upon seeking out a professional so that she can verify clinical results for an article she is working on jo gets caught up in the experiment these many years later can she help herself to deal with what is about to start happening to her will she be strong enough to change a past life for the good of a woman she never even heard of will jo ##s physical manifestation ##s cat ##ap ##ult around her sucking in people she knows as well as strangers to the point that not only is the past coming to life but the present is changing also this story has a double intensity as far as im concerned for i do believe in past lives belonging to one person one soul multiple rendition ##s of lives lived

people along superb reading if your ##e in the mood for an epic drama involving h ##yp ##nosis and past ##life regression during modern times faced against historical welsh fiction then barbara erskine ##s lady of hay is definitely the book to read what an extraordinary novel lady of hay is the story of jo clifford a heads ##tron ##g journalist who falls prey to being an easy subject for past ##life regression within h ##yp ##nosis or even rein ##car ##nation when jo is under h ##yp ##nosis she lives the life of matilda de bra ##ose a woman heads ##tron ##g in her own time during the late th and early th centuries not only does jo bring components of matilda back to present time scars and bruises for example but we also begin to learn that her present ##day lover nick and his brother sam are also present ##day men that knew matilda what you may ask lady of hay is abundant ##ly full of int ##rigue suspense and violence and is good enough to keep your interest despite its length of over pages lady of hay will pull you in and its combination of past and present events are distributed evenly and taste ##fully throughout the book we become frustrated that jo is forever drawn to nick whose past ##life character continues to hurt her and we also become emotional when dealing with matilda ##s life wo ##es and hardship ##s the only aspect of the book i disagree with is jo ##s weakness in regards to nick i figured a strong intelligent woman would not keep su ##cc ##umb ##ing to nick ##s advances the red ##unda ##ncy of jo constantly returning to nick becomes annoying as we reach the end although the novel was written in lady of hay is still very much a classic the dialogue between the present ##day characters is a little times ##ens ##itive and old ##fa ##shi ##oned but it does not deter from the storyline and the joy ##ful experience of the book lady of hay is barbara erskine ##s debut novel and i am disappointed that i did not learn about the author sooner barbara erskine is now very prolific in historical fiction featuring wales and her latest title is called times legacy i plan on adding all of erskine ##s novels to my wish list for future reading the plot has been described by other reviewers the one point i want to add is that the behavior of the medieval characters is extremely brutal although in that way the story is much more true to the past than most historical novels if you are sensitive as i am you may find the descriptions disturbing in any event not something to read while you are feeling blue i enjoyed this but i would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had all been in matilda ##s past and skipped the stuff in the present time the idea of regression was interesting but it got to be a bit much after a while i mean how many people do you know that are experienced h ##yp ##not ##ists and jo was h ##yp ##not ##ized by was it four or five different people that did become a bit of a stretch towards the end of the book spoil ##er also unless i missed something i don ##t think sam ##s obsession with the whole jo ##mat ##il ##da thing was explained to my satisfaction how did he become so evil to the point of harm ##ing his brother you should be advised that this is not your true historical fiction matilda william de bra ##ose richard etc were real people but as the author notes at the end not all that happened in the book to jo ##mat ##il ##da actually happened to the real matilda i almost didn ##t read this book because of what really happened to matilda yes she was held prisoner with her son and they starved to death but the story ended a bit more gr ##ues ##ome than that if what i read in sk ##ps welsh trilogy is true i was relieved that erskine left that part out otherwise an interesting read i blew through it quickly four stars instead of five for the inc ##ons ##iste ##ncies it seems that the reviews for this book are all over the map this is totally understand ##able to me as i just finished the book and spent a while sorting my feelings about it out that said i really like this book ill tell you why in a moment jo clifford is nineteen years old and volunteers to be a patient in a h ##yp ##nosis experiment taking place at her college while under h ##yp ##nosis jo becomes extremely agitated and then her hands begin to bleed the professor conducting the experiment is thrilled he thinks joanna is showing signs of stigma ##ta but his assistant sam frankly ##n is scared then jo ##s hearts stops and she nearly dies sam manages to bring her back to life this is the pro ##log fast forward fifteen years jo has recently broken up with nick who is sam ##s younger brother she is a freelance journalist and is starting to write a series on nostalgia one of the articles is about past lives and rein ##car ##nation at this point she has no idea what happened to her all those years in the college experiment because the doctor conducting it gave her a post hypnotic suggestion so she wouldn ##t remember nick does know and try ##s to di ##ss ##ua ##de her from writing the article but she is too mad at him for cheating on her to care so she begins to write the article and is h ##yp ##not ##ized by a doctor she goes to interview immediately jo is flung back into the past she is matilda de bra ##ose women who is married to a twelve century marche ##r lord in wales but is love with the handsome richard de clare and king currently prince john of robin hood fame is in love with her as jo continues her trips to the past via regression it becomes obvious that the three men in matilda ##s life her husband william her lover richard and her lord john are all involved in jo ##s life as well the men sam nick and tim a photographer jo frequently works with begin to act strangely this book was very exciting the story line is going at a break neck speed until about page four hundred when it slow ##s down it bit it does seem like some of it could be cut but i couldn ##t tell you what parts my only grip ##es with this book are few the scenes in the past can be a little boring the evil man in jo ##s life seemed to becomes very evil very fast and i don ##t think you can really h ##yp ##not ##ize someone over the phone also i was a little confused about the scenes where jo thought she was matilda talking to her husband but really she was being h ##yp ##not ##ized and something like the conversation she was having never really took place in matilda ##s life you ##ll understand that if you read the book sp ##oli ##er alert also given everything that happened in the book the ending was a little un realistic i mean after having a man rape you in not one but two incarnation ##s it seems like you ##d have trouble trusting him again much less loving him but the destiny aspect of the book sort of makes it all seem ok not that its ever acceptable to rape someone it just sort of explains it and hey its fiction i give this book a very solid four point five stars and i would definitely try something else by this author i am an avid reader of historical fiction with the emphasis on the historical rather than the up ##th ##rus ##t breast variety this catastrophe fails at both i have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the put ##rid lady of hay falls somewhere below this last category as other readers have commented this book is about pages too long the author has managed to confuse ted ##ium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion ms erskine ##s attempts to inter ##we ##ave the present day plot with historical narrative is a complete failure as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a her ##ky ##jer ##ky narrative flow that became quite annoying compound ##ing the problem not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic and although i began the read with curiosity and interest i ended feeling frustrated and cheated there are many red herring ##s dropped along the way that kept me reading but i got no satisfaction at the end why do we meet everyone ##s mother how many literary agents photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names only to drop from sight pages later what about nurse jeanne ##s fore ##sha ##do ##wing of matilda ##s illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in cal ##ami ##ty did i miss that scene as i wade ##d through episode after repetitive episode of modern jo sw ##oon ##ing in the rain as she channels lady matilda there are too many super ##fl ##uous characters seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression who i kept expecting would have some role in the overall meaning of this mora ##ss but they never did not to mention most of the players seem good candidates for alcoholic ##s anonymous i cannot recall another novel which features wine ale scotch pi ##mm ##s and their il ##k as the central focus in seemingly every scene the insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning a medieval lost weekend i became so exasperated with their antics and cruel mis ##dee ##ds that i actually found myself root ##ing for them all to be sent to the poke ##y or a rehab facility this book was a major disappointment in every way it is short on history and long on art ##ifice if there were some way to award negative stars this is the ideal candidate save your money lady of hay makes a promising start jo is a young journalist who researches past life regression for a magazine article as research she undergoes h ##yp ##nosis and discovers that she is not only easily h ##yp ##not ##ized so easily that later in the book someone calls and h ##yp ##not ##izes her over the phone but in a previous life she was matilda de bra ##ose a th century welsh ##woman how exciting i said to myself this could be very fun matilda is a real historical figure i love historical fiction i would enjoy the puzzle of matching past lives with present characters and of course i hoped for romance but ala ##sit was not to be the first half of the book was great it keeps up a good pace and intriguing events un ##fold as jo and her present life alternate with regression ##s to matilda ##s existence but by the second half of the book there is no new material and far too much repetition as well in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##ble violence against the main character that simply turned me off to her possible love interests in the st half of the book we learn that men love jo in both the past and the present and we know who they were in their past lives we also learn about the end of matilda ##s life very early in the story so where can the author take us from here i hoped that some of the modern day characters besides the men would eventually be revealed to have some involvement in the past lives or a more important role in the present however they don ##t i also expected that that the author might expand on history and offer an explanation for the legend of matilda building hay castle in one night she doesn ##t and i was disappointed with the mundane theory about rumors that matilda was a witch the explanation she studied herb lore with her nurse jeanne and rides horses swiftly like a man but perhaps most disappointing of all is the fact that nick the man she is in love with in the present was very cruel to her in her past life and not very nice to her in the present and there is no satisfactory explanation of why nor did it seem that his behavior was ever an obstacle to their relationship in the present and what about sam ##s behavior the actions of of jo ##s lovers leaves me questioning how much if at all they really cared for her richard was the one nice guy and i was hoping he would somehow turn out to be a hero but when he turns out to be a junk ##ie i think my hopes for a satisfying finale were extinguished maybe the fact that men are supposedly in love with the main character is the romantic attraction of this book or is it jo ##s suffering that is intended to be attractive perhaps i was ultimately disappointed because of the promising start but my advice is to skip this book i bought and read this book when i was and visited london at i adored it passionate ##ly at much older than i find it a bit laugh ##able first i agree with several reviewers who object to the strong independent heroine being raped and abused and finding her happily ever after with one of her rap ##ists his excuse was that he was hypnotic ##ally reg ##ressed to king john at the time oh well of course the historical parts of the book are outstanding detailed and well ##res ##ear ##ched and they win of the three stars that i give this book readers of sharon kay pen ##mans _ here be dragons _ will find this an excellent companion piece in fact if you love medieval welsh history i highly recommend getting this book and just flipping the pages whenever the modern characters appear the original cover art i have from my british edition reads fascinating absorbing and original the first two are subjective but as many reviewers have pointed out it is hardly original anya seton ##s _ green darkness _ and mary luke ##s _ none ##su ##ch lure _ played the same themes at least years before _ lady of hay _ was published but it became even less original when barbara er ##ks ##ine began searching out abused women in british history and did the same thing over and over again in ##ject ##ing historically inaccurate feminism along the way _ lady of hay _ is definitely the best of her efforts in the past ##life regression genre disappointing no thoughtful self respecting woman would be attracted to this book or to this author after reading this book this writer is acclaimed for her scholar ##liness so i was terribly disappointed this book off ##end ##s me she sets feminism back by decades with her repeated and offensive rape fantasies one scene was to ##ler ##able since it sends the idea that in those days women were mere chat ##tel but please i threw it out after the second one i picked it back up to give the author another chance and finally just grew too disgusted by rape scene number to continue i would not want my daughter to read it nor my son the women characters past present were di ##sl ##oya ##l dish ##ones ##t and mani ##pu ##lative the men dec ##eit ##ful weak or brutal one may hope that erskine does not depend as heavily on alcohol as her heroine does about a third of the way through the book it became laugh ##able if you seek a good rein ##car ##nation novel try amy tan ##s super ##lative wonderful hundred secret senses the more serious search for the girl with the blue eyes by jess stern ##e or even the romantic fiction somewhere in time anya seton ##s green darkness is another and i do believe erskine relied heavily upon its plot scheme and characters if she did not simply pl ##agi ##ari ##ze my message to the readers don ##t bother my message to barbara erskine get a therapist or switch to red ##co ##ver heaving bo ##som press so that i won ##t be fooled again you should find rape rep ##ulsive not ti ##tila ##ting or romantic you should not use it to sell books at woman ##kind ##s expense for shame i bought lady of hay used a few years ago and didn ##t pick it up again for a few months iv ##e always been fascinated with past lives but usually the way it is portrayed is unbelievable this book on the other hand is fantastic imagine been put under h ##yp ##nosis and having a past life emerge for the author to actually use a real person from history is great ##it made me think and i even looked her up i read this book again every few months just for pure enjoyment hardened journalist jo clifford is working on an investigative piece to de ##bu ##nk rein ##car ##nation and regression h ##yp ##nosis there ##s only one problem the fact that once she agrees to be h ##yp ##not ##ised in order to try and be fair she has very realistic images of a woman from the middle ages matilda lady of hay is jo really the rein ##car ##nation of someone who lived hundreds of years ago or is she just remembering some facts that she had forgotten from long ago history lessons fl ##itt ##ing between jo ##s modern life and matilda ##s past life the book is a real page turner keeping you guessing until the very end the regression is handled quite well and as you finish the book you do begin to wonder if rein ##car ##nation is such a far fetch ##ed idea after all barbara erskine has the talent to weave a spell with words you just have to finish the books once started reviewed by annette gi ##sby author of silent screams coincidentally i had just finished reading here be dragons by sharon kay pen ##man that covered a somewhat later period of welsh history but featured many of the same historical figures as this book here be dragons is ten times the book this is if i have one pet pee ##ve it would have to be authors who command their characters to do ill ##ogical things case in point at the beginning of this novel the title character jo has just broken off a relationship with the man in her life who has gone off to pursue another woman yet there is no discussion of what pre ##ci ##pta ##ted the breakup and the heroine non ##chal ##antly allows the rat to waltz b ##lit ##hel ##y in and out of her life and apartment without batting an eye ##lash the rat and his brother also have a relationship about as fra ##tern ##al as kane and abel but there is no discussion whatsoever as to why i also found it rather ridiculous that all the men in jo ##s modern existence had all followed her from her previous incarnation years ago the heroine also runs around wales falling spontaneously into reg ##ress ##ive hypnotic trance ##s at the drop of a mil ##ady the author even had one of her year old medieval characters utter hey like he was hail ##ing a cab cm ##on maybe this book should be better classified as science fiction i am as willing as the next person to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good yarn but because of the authors ina ##bl ##ity to flesh out the details to make her protagonists credible i found the characters of this novel did not develop beyond cardboard cut ##outs my advice you money and your time would be better spent on here be dragons by sharon kay pen ##man go read the reviews on this site for that book great story ##su ##pr ##ise ending ##ex ##cit ##ing and fast paced everything barbara erskine writes is awesome this book is a ho ##rri ##d combination of writing that is good enough to keep you reading and bad enough that you wish you weren ##t the book is pages the heroine is repeatedly raped force ##ably and not or otherwise abused by men who supposedly love her she repeatedly makes stupid choices leaving the reader to wonder how smart she really is there are too many irrelevant characters the ending is completely un ##sat ##is ##fying given how long i spent to sl ##og through the book the author is not bad in terms of description but the only real element of suspense will be figured out by a thinking reader by page or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page avoid this book if you love historical and contemporary fiction as i do this is the book for you this particular novel is two stories in one one is the story of lady math ##il ##da of th century wales while the other story parallel to that of math ##il ##da is about jo clifford reporter note the definitive word parallel because jo and math ##il ##da are one and the same person in different incarnation ##s along with the people with whom they interact in their respective lifetime ##s this book has all the elements of a good story beautiful visuals of the century welsh landscape and castles not to mention murder suspense mystery and romance another page ##turn ##er to be sure for me the book started off pretty slowly i really didn ##t get into it till the th or th chapter from then on though i couldn ##t put it down i liked the characters better in the past though i was far more anxious to read about them then jo and the rest from the th century it was a refreshing read i recommend this book and also kingdom of shadows which i absolutely loved', 'recommendation': 'it was first
